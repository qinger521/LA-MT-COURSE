3005	because you know what ?
6300	what do these people need ?
5181	how interested you are .
2115	let &apos;s call it don .
5205	so how does this work ?
1401	we can do it differently .
241	those days are over .
2716	bg : thank you .
2352	and i was an artist .
3162	how do we know ?
4563	i have a question .
5978	i think that &apos;s interesting .
6094	i don &apos;t think so .
629	can we change it ?
2889	it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
1046	what are media today ?
6032	i thought about it .
4297	i was faced with him .
2206	they &apos;re bad . &quot;
3331	so you can do that .
6245	here &apos;s an example .
871	so let &apos;s see .
2983	it &apos;s not a country .
1484	not school management .
4644	that would have been okay .
4010	so where do we go ?
3763	so it &apos;s true .
4256	you can go inside .
807	this is the last one .
6358	somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
1237	that &apos;s our present .
2635	this is a wish .
5220	what happened here ?
1593	i &apos;m all interested in that .
2258	can i be honest ?
5553	and that &apos;s important .
887	yeah , good afternoon .
1902	yeah , good afternoon .
1654	lento , slowly .
3776	it has sensors .
1553	we can do that .
713	just do your job .
5321	centers have been built .
3564	there &apos;s no normal .
540	this was the result .
4411	you could see manhattan .
2880	but you know what ?
2016	that &apos;s the system .
6636	these people deserve money .
1472	the whole environmental debate .
863	flying cat .
2973	why do we do that ?
5630	they use their hands .
5384	i don &apos;t know .
3098	yeah , i know .
1435	and it has to go back .
2766	what was the result ?
3629	that &apos;s very good .
5783	again , she evaluated it .
5152	but you know what ?
1243	yeah , milliseconds .
4217	here &apos;s the video .
3378	players don &apos;t sit around .
5407	what creates the illusion ?
2876	the data came in .
2199	there &apos;s no food .
3131	but it didn &apos;t .
326	here &apos;s another example .
4922	i created one .
6368	and that &apos;s how it was .
4547	but it gets worse .
4691	it keeps you fresh .
2469	it &apos;s a huge challenge .
4279	this is where you see it .
1391	isn &apos;t that sad ?
4748	yeah . all right .
5355	just after a trip there .
2848	people were playing crazy .
1476	but the wrong things .
6633	there are online criminals .
3147	there &apos;s an old study .
5247	there were remixes .
2733	and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
3649	some have come and gone .
4808	that &apos;s a great question .
6454	he always showed up here .
4631	think about the camera .
4194	he really enjoyed it .
5191	let me summarize .
5249	and then it became international .
4111	good afternoon , everybody .
5280	he &apos;s my grandfather .
1224	does anybody see anything particular ?
4109	thank you very much .
4149	this is the city .
5356	my gut feeling again .
3805	i swear it .
2800	and i understand that .
1129	he &apos;s not going to do that .
4437	it feels great .
1659	i wonder .
1007	thank you for listening .
480	why should we do that ?
3490	thank you .
381	they even hurt .
5984	i teach kids .
552	i &apos;m a writer .
1735	it &apos;s against justice .
4621	jk : both .
5108	first of all , narrow .
3655	maybe 10 times as many .
3819	be a mentor .
5501	oh . a moment .
257	what do they want to do ?
6013	or pre-bombs .
6416	so she was back .
6627	that &apos;s what &apos;s happening today .
1354	let me tell you .
5509	okay . thank you .
2544	we need energy miracles .
1143	why is this happening at all ?
5857	i go in here .
5664	there are two options .
6407	but i kept working .
1519	not poisonous in it .
1842	you see it immediately .
6450	and i kept working .
4064	will i like the color ?
5763	it has billions of them .
2567	who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
4565	is that your opinion ?
4059	ooh , thank you .
6687	privacy has to be given .
4810	my name is amit .
5655	they look like this .
712	don &apos;t be discouraged .
6211	and a lot of people forget this .
6558	it was still fish .
1980	what would have to be done ?
3566	i don &apos;t think so much .
5616	have you seen these guys ?
2900	it &apos;s called paul offit .
6390	i felt really good .
1037	they didn &apos;t have mass media .
2130	let &apos;s call him don too .
4817	i grew up in india .
3983	so what happened years after that ?
5996	i think that &apos;s fascinating .
1010	how do we actually make people work ?
5989	the only country in the world .
1314	give pee a chance .
4678	that &apos;s the short line .
94	so , what does that mean ?
1394	but where are we useful ?
6000	i think that &apos;s fascinating .
3271	that &apos;s not true of emotions .
1561	the work of the interpreter .
5927	i &apos;ll never forget that .
1412	it was different in china .
6632	we have three main groups .
1333	but that &apos;s not protection .
6003	it &apos;s not our problem .
1815	i mean the soul .
5160	okay , a few more .
5388	is it photography at all ?
5920	i &apos;ll never forget .
6005	it &apos;s not our struggle .
2415	that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
318	very expensive real estate .
6451	and then it happened again .
4686	that &apos;s a great question .
1381	luckily not , yes ?
3264	dk : 60,000 .
2934	i agree with them .
5461	there &apos;s something else .
5431	here &apos;s another example .
5977	we &apos;ve lost the contact .
4383	they did it secretly .
4519	a nearly identical structure .
1589	you place comparison .
2814	and why is that ?
3133	he had the experience .
6034	it would be unbearable .
570	and i always had that .
3107	yeah , there it is .
5262	ohuh .
6186	crisis . death . disaster .
4834	just go on . lots of fun .
4516	and it got even better .
4884	the answer to that is no .
2194	but what are your fish eating ?
857	the orange tractor .
3431	this is the exciting one .
2873	very scary .
4995	they called me .
4687	legendary technology .
3725	these changes are on the ground .
1071	what actually happened ?
343	but i felt worse .
3067	but the key thing is ...
3632	how about fitness ?
3039	this is how it works .
1995	and then they set them up .
5546	and that &apos;s nothing .
6247	he &apos;s the guy on the left .
3638	or is it possible ?
1035	they didn &apos;t have books .
6200	maybe that &apos;s the reality .
3553	conflicts emerge from creativity .
852	this is felix .
1850	i can say anything .
1392	so we &apos;re too many .
6035	it would be geeky .
1922	we were twenty people .
3348	it might sound bad .
1318	you can &apos;t have bones .
3480	i &apos;ll get to the end .
5227	this is what the graphics looked like .
6155	what else can we do ?
1816	what is the soul ?
1086	we no longer produce ourselves .
2640	so what do we have to do ?
6464	and fortunately , he did not die .
5853	and this opens up a map .
73	now , what does that mean ?
5950	i was devastated .
4440	you see the water coming .
2521	first , we have the population .
6725	i &apos;ll stop that .
860	... invent his own story .
5406	is it about the light ?
3481	i want to ask you something .
2646	we have to spread the message .
2035	this is preconceived .
2771	now what do you think happened ?
2259	i don &apos;t like that question .
3686	i wanted to keep us healthy .
4429	i had a good life .
3843	who are these related ?
3457	the game is from 2007 .
4291	his name is tempt .
6142	he went up and down .
3436	that sounds crazy , right ?
6021	we &apos;re continually bumping each other .
5666	that &apos;s kind of it .
4063	will it have my size ?
5839	but what do we do with that ?
1656	that &apos;s what most people know .
955	you see that down there .
6041	we love technology and creativity .
2970	you don &apos;t want to do that ?
5180	what do i look at ?
636	why not think that ?
1264	you also have to understand that .
6392	actually , i made two errors .
4162	they saw the big impact .
5158	okay , there are a few .
6519	it divides your experience with others .
2092	i just loved two .
1200	so it &apos;s circle .
5059	think about your own decisions .
4812	and it took 18 months .
1941	can &apos;t be a problem at all .
4879	i might not have to say that .
776	this was about christmas .
1901	thank you for your attention .
1868	that &apos;s such a natural thing .
3156	and here &apos;s a surprise .
4838	i see this plusal sign .
5207	well , then we want .
2749	who &apos;s the most successful one ?
1198	recognition should work .
3626	how many people would choose creativity ?
6004	it &apos;s not our burden .
4219	you can have this cloud .
4535	that &apos;s cool , right ?
6338	and there are hundreds of them .
6551	it was my first sunburn .
5362	her mother put her on her own .
248	the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
4179	the data wasn &apos;t available before .
574	is that sensible ?
2949	that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
2209	&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2722	it was a huge success .
4730	tell me about this world .
5028	one place is south korea .
567	that &apos;s about , you know .
901	so , why hacking now ?
1884	again , here you have it again .
2270	you want to feed the world ?
4158	first extension , second .
4320	that was the start of the journey .
5020	this picture is from this place .
3390	and finally , epic meaning .
1784	my wife told me her .
4445	but it was very sad .
3563	let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
2105	there &apos;s almost nothing left .
3801	well , i was the next .
2847	the same thing , only bigger .
843	they really loved it .
5599	they connected these two people .
6684	i don &apos;t have to worry .
4507	and that worked very well .
1725	and how did that feel ?
4164	and then everybody went down .
6100	sometimes i &apos;m pushing too much .
2113	i wanted to support them .
291	the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
1680	because you can train that .
4262	i was so frightened .
657	what is this thing ?
1559	does that make you curious ?
4657	this is very risky .
5793	but they do the job .
6499	and that &apos;s the crux .
364	they could have done better .
4544	the power plant can explode .
2917	no one ever said that .
1518	so not like detox .
6355	but , you know what ?
2617	what should our belief look like ?
5965	today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
6502	we can &apos;t get rid of it .
4197	the whole building consisted of water .
3396	they create an epic story .
393	everybody needs a goldfish glass .
6733	and it was an incredible experience .
6492	but there are two problems .
5271	the story is not over yet .
5708	so what &apos;s the next step ?
6524	my name is brian goldman .
4222	they can play with different ways .
3188	they haven &apos;t changed the story .
4478	and then something weird happened .
2905	and he actually says that .
6230	that was grandiose .
6006	i talk a lot about these questions .
2569	that &apos;s a lot of volume .
3232	they have so much uncertainty .
2017	and of course , that &apos;s unbelievable .
5452	how can we help you ? &quot;
4901	they basically do the same thing .
4941	and then we did .
3847	play doesn &apos;t just mean children &apos;s games .
6294	the white lines are population .
4756	what other brands do ?
2851	i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
6261	and there &apos;s good news .
5122	it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
3637	is this all just education ?
6417	she was back and dying .
4880	they come from the artists .
6370	i learned everything memorized .
1114	this is a game for outside .
5660	but that &apos;s not so fast .
1836	now there &apos;s a third sentence .
3709	now , how could this happen ?
4994	again , he showed him jafour .
1194	for example , that perception in context .
370	so let me remind you .
6559	people were still happy .
3113	everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
5229	what happened that day ?
1939	they always say , why ?
1196	does anybody know what that is ?
5823	that made me really sad .
698	that &apos;s god , you know ?
5408	sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
5336	no , no , it had never been an opportunity .
6536	he actually collected fish .
2100	&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
3873	play is not silly .
2384	so they saw something magical .
3442	so , we can do that .
2824	so that &apos;s the good news .
1713	it just wasn &apos;t invented .
3241	it &apos;s a completely different term .
4384	she did it for three years .
6266	let &apos;s talk about water wars .
2121	2.5 to one , great .
2931	the data is constantly lighting this .
2638	this one has the biggest impact .
1388	and so we &apos;re too many .
1317	you can &apos;t store energy .
6445	but slowly , it made sure .
3069	and the shape plays a role .
2400	that &apos;s why i made the movie .
6399	my second mistake was worse .
5675	we &apos;re not going to go further than that .
6070	what are they trying to achieve ? &quot;
6336	we all love baseball , right ?
1860	and we &apos;re very happy about this .
1493	every waste is nutrients .
2887	because anybody here have masses ?
4124	they &apos;re going to be free to computers .
1299	and then i can transmit the whole thing .
6576	once we started a vibrant .
5951	i &apos;m going to tell you something .
1754	they &apos;re getting more and more similar .
2358	creativity had to somehow get out .
6414	the nurse was always wondering .
5952	i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
5474	maybe even in our mobile phones .
1844	because i can say anything .
600	so the question is , how ?
4643	that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
6517	and it starts with a doctor .
4841	these are all metadata .
5880	we use the sun &apos;s energy .
562	okay , that &apos;s really courageous .
6353	somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
6357	and it &apos;s going to beat a 257 .
1327	and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
2475	what lessons did we learn ?
5241	that &apos;s it , really easy .
27	let them be galvanized . &quot;
2235	i almost never cook with it .
1867	he doesn &apos;t have those soul .
1541	right now , that &apos;s waste .
3623	which one would you like the most ?
2906	so paul is a terrorist .
6446	i started feeling better .
1786	an autistic student .
4057	but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
4160	italy wins . yeah .
2111	doesn &apos;t taste very well either .
3782	and this was 19 years ago .
2869	don &apos;t take anything for granted .
4151	in the morning , before the game .
2508	that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
4281	that &apos;s about five meters long .
2192	he pointed at the algae .
1893	and you already have a problem .
2704	underneath that , other things shouldn &apos;t be sufficient .
2740	and then realizing him .
161	i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
1933	there are four and a half thousand people .
5868	somehow , the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
4840	this is now one of the images .
1936	it just isn &apos;t technological .
5656	and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
1324	we depend on two countries .
1983	and again , this is the representation .
5019	we went into an area .
270	today everything is easy to have .
2066	so i just started playing .
1932	yeah , that &apos;s the data .
4737	i like things that are different .
4286	and this video is real time .
1400	so you can &apos;t solve this at all .
6580	it &apos;s not documented .
137	there &apos;s no way you can do anything .
2466	and that really changed the dynamic .
4574	i went to prison -- difficult .
1664	this is like talking learning .
338	do you want to delete jeans ?
4154	the game starts -- silence .
353	the truth is more like this .
3234	so the correlation is gering .
1000	and that &apos;s at the very beginning .
1724	have you been neither ?
1976	and then we said , okay .
4915	and i &apos;ve never seen them .
1485	we say sustainability in germany .
4472	this is a child game , right ?
5836	it can know where we are .
1591	how and what did he feel ?
5533	it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
1316	otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
3345	they &apos;re just better than reality .
4349	isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
4480	it didn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
1629	because to me , it means memory .
3634	what about longevity ?
6663	they sell certificate .
4065	is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
3813	and you know what i learned ?
5290	all adults were aware of the risks .
1351	this is completely trivial .
792	let &apos;s leave that quiet .
6444	why did i go to medicine ?
4655	what else is risky ?
4747	thank you very much for your patience .
2762	i now tried a little more exciting .
1453	but really , really effective , yes ?
6427	her family gathered together .
2571	next , nuclear power .
1244	it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
4546	that &apos;s scary .
4680	we &apos;re a smaller brand .
4406	that sounds frightening .
1590	the motivation to write it .
3170	what is a story of ?
1070	anyway , not to navigate .
3026	so , look what happens .
1729	i shoot something through my head .
4087	just be who you are .
6660	and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
3793	i remember my first fire .
1397	nullemissions , yes ?
2935	dark urine . dark .
1440	but we need it all together .
4699	huh , my brand ?
6133	once the judge saw me .
6121	so i went to the court .
5824	i got something scared of technology .
1809	we can &apos;t do it easy .
4846	this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
3591	i really wanted to make normal at that time .
4235	you can do it all the time .
1539	if you get to that , right ?
4855	it seemed to be pretty popular .
4270	but the truth is far from it .
2790	and that can make a huge difference .
4943	so we measured his movement .
6177	they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
504	sunlight and co2 are a method .
2342	so i &apos;ll stop , thank you very much .
2676	anyway , we need a solution .
1871	so he &apos;s right in the middle .
5727	and these are the neural structures .
1972	how far do you get there ?
4024	it turns out to be really difficult .
1076	on the book and on the picture .
2136	in the presumption of maybe two percent .
1328	it makes leukemia in kids .
5435	but it requires a lot of planning .
2305	now i see greg lemond .
4566	okay , you really want to know ?
5819	now we do that with airplanes .
5350	we didn &apos;t have a cent for a year .
3339	and then we get this whole positive feedback .
414	we started it 15 years ago .
1491	that &apos;s the minimum right now .
3394	five million people use it every month .
6199	but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
5731	this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
2172	they flooded the channels .
2980	it has nothing to do with science .
1658	and yet it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
3663	but what will happen in the future ?
1402	we can get our nutrients back .
1497	you can show that i was there .
6505	i don &apos;t take the same process .
4026	do we really want to go this way ?
589	i find it adventurous .
4965	well , that &apos;s not quite right .
3153	and that &apos;s a very simple question .
5558	they didn &apos;t give up the government .
2076	music is medicine . music is changing us .
4296	he can only use his eyes .
1628	this must be the difference of aging .
1235	anybody know what three seconds is ?
4848	you see something funny here .
2603	this is a pretty crazy idea .
1723	you know what neither is ?
6557	they were genetically expressed .
4927	this is a picture of the object .
6525	i &apos;m the newly defined doctor .
772	this picture reminded me of something .
309	and there are several reasons for this .
4701	i really like beautiful clothes .
2738	but there &apos;s another reason .
6270	because we live on a planet of water .
6688	privacy is not a debate .
6704	lego made it possible for everybody .
3738	these will be irresistant .
6337	baseball is full of great statistics .
5508	oh , my time is over ?
5312	something rose in me .
1709	so the first step to an interpretation .
2353	i could draw . i could paint .
2140	i fell away from this fish .
6531	it &apos;s about portable standards .
2230	do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
1554	we can reinvent everything again .
5166	who do you really want to inform with this ?
5945	my brother started me .
4627	we have to think about what brands are .
253	a has these benefits and risks .
2037	it &apos;s easy , it &apos;s going to come .
6233	risk is not a simple game .
5580	we didn &apos;t write these app .
6718	the stones are colored .
6685	i have nothing to hide . &quot;
2261	a billion people are going to starve today .
1775	no , no , it &apos;s not .
6642	björn sundin .
5127	here &apos;s a description of the street .
5252	who could have predicted all this ?
4301	what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
1313	and it depends on phosphorus .
3443	we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
5988	we already have a lot of lawsuits .
5208	oh my god . oh my god .
3347	that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
4885	it &apos;s supposed to fill the experience .
2857	and that got me through so ...
4078	i call this the radiant tiger .
1924	it &apos;s focused on acuity .
5073	here &apos;s the olive oil aisle .
1206	often in the third one , forget again .
5038	they even bring in funding .
5896	i learned this from my grandmother .
5379	the defeat would have been too easy .
744	these rivers are speeding up .
4600	that was more for concrete .
1630	he was already over 70 .
2533	we have something that doesn &apos;t increase .
1707	and this sounds very different from before .
755	this is the memory basin .
963	it was a pretty destiny project .
5993	this is a very sensitive question .
3032	and the goal is very simple .
2750	architects and engineers , thankfully .
3733	who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
5456	and every morning , i jumped on it .
5381	who would ever wish ?
854	this is where he makes the sun go .
1026	i &apos;d like to prove that to you .
4850	but then they really want deep inside .
5583	how do i get it away ? &quot;
4357	we &apos;ve won some awards .
3440	so this crazy story could be true .
3029	i push my sleeve back .
149	our magazines are read by millions .
3297	no , i mean it really serious .
3040	i hold the knife in my hand .
3430	but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
1286	and what does this mean for the designer ?
5169	we need to increase complexity .
4831	you want to orient yourself in the museum ?
6071	i started with my usual talk .
5361	her father died soon after her birth .
5078	here &apos;s your brand gang .
4385	and i had to get out of town .
2961	this is ideology , not science .
6596	you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
6137	i had written these crazy things .
4482	completely targeted for a particular goal .
5279	he died , broken through history .
4203	this is how the building works .
2570	so this is a tough nut .
41	they interfered with each other .
6058	it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
5831	they kept us from being inspired .
1696	tell them what they feel .
2090	i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
5990	i represent people in death cells .
4726	you &apos;ve taken your pictures with you , right ?
4954	i think that &apos;s really cool .
4140	let &apos;s start with the feeling .
5084	now we saw the reverse effect .
1504	so there are two cycles .
432	we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
1019	that sounds kind of unusual first .
1840	and that &apos;s where you feel it .
1854	these things are obviously correct .
2556	for energy , this one came to mind .
5786	all of these generations need just a few milliseconds .
3603	the students are divided into grades .
4752	they do very well .
1093	the question is , what &apos;s next ?
1797	he &apos;s interested in firemen .
1800	that &apos;s where he signed up .
1803	here you have this little mechanism .
1080	let &apos;s make a little intermediate image .
5791	i tried to understand them .
6359	but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
5008	that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
922	it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
6163	i think there are opportunities everywhere .
6010	we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
4787	the film was not delivered yet .
1912	these are called projectors today .
5846	i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
2522	today , 6.8 billion people live .
1478	as we think from the north .
6421	they made their blood pressure up .
6019	we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
5859	these are the apsaras .
6213	in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
5953	this may be public broadcast .
1872	that &apos;s how nature is presented .
1876	he automatically runs to the right thought .
1555	i started an institute to do this .
1356	in the people over the urine .
6628	and nobody seems to get upset about that .
1223	i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
6472	the other one had strong diarrhea .
4684	in terms of what would you describe ban ?
3369	if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
54	the living bears are the ghosts .
2786	there are also world records .
795	fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
3700	we &apos;ve achieved some kind of balance .
2794	and everybody in this room has to go in .
4836	thank you , but the best one is coming .
3385	happy productivity . fantastic !
2881	the result of that was catastrophic .
1461	asking , what &apos;s the right thing ?
4698	how would you describe your brand ?
1498	but with the right design , there you go .
1956	we also got very precise data .
6308	what are these three billion people going to bring ?
4599	i &apos;m a speaker .
5649	something very strange is going on here .
1421	we can support them to be good .
1358	so men can &apos;t be pigs .
6526	i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
3354	that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe .
1030	and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
1335	that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
4949	let &apos;s think about the atoms .
1764	behind the seven mountains and so on .
2437	it was really , really , really profound .
3856	look at what she &apos;s doing .
4377	this is a painting of a circle .
4199	the roof was also covered with water .
1212	you first see from the back to the front .
6577	it hasn &apos;t been drowned yet .
6441	but i kept asking these questions .
1278	this is also a paradigm shift .
4077	let &apos;s start with sunday .
4414	that &apos;s usually not the route .
6487	this is the system that we live in .
5244	even cats look at this video .
6110	you should have some wishes .
4654	and it &apos;s also very risky .
3985	and women argued that successfully .
1430	we can support them to be good .
6438	and that &apos;s what i felt .
4622	so ... so , not that optimistic .
275	these are all inconvenient questions .
2170	they literally moved the lever around .
5348	so i followed my gut feeling .
5352	we worked very late in the night .
3482	what do you think is going to happen next ?
3533	widrives just belong to our lives .
3719	it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
5784	perhaps lead some mutations .
1423	the byproduct is clean water .
5278	he moved back to silence .
6219	now look at this curve .
5009	politely , everybody applauded .
5572	so scott gets this fruit .
2120	&quot; the best one in the industry . &quot;
2515	it &apos;s been constant .
2957	they have them . they always have them .
1644	especially when he &apos;s already died .
4	we go through initiation rituals .
2860	we talk about it twenty .
1225	a dalmatiner , right .
3802	the main man was waving me .
1740	the mechanism comes from the lie .
3456	this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
808	it &apos;s about a recovery of america .
4640	no , that was what i thought .
4415	he shuts down the power plants .
1309	and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
1145	so from the modern to the computer society .
5221	this is where jimmy kimmel came .
3493	i &apos;m going to read you the entry .
5502	it might take up until it &apos;s invited .
5281	i never personally met him .
5322	i lived in parallel worlds .
4896	they can be logical and intuitive .
2838	not even the truth will release it .
6396	maybe i did it with good reason .
5248	somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
3350	so the first exciting primate .
4294	and that was the outbreak of it .
2581	and the other thing is that these wells underground .
1142	maybe you have to look at it again .
2912	we now have masers in this country .
5438	the bank is from another place .
1625	that &apos;s the contract part .
2204	&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
5376	&quot; you haven &apos;t let them go . &quot;
527	and this picture was taken by atlas .
1055	no , no , far lacking .
3065	the dosage also matters .
2710	and even lomborg is thinking .
6086	i learned some very simple things .
4742	tell me a little bit about this part .
1184	just to say , what &apos;s information ?
2817	they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
3117	everybody would like to make people happier .
2186	i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
4031	we don &apos;t have the conditions of this species .
5578	boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
6210	we live in a really extraordinary time .
6269	&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
148	156 nations send our tv channel .
3558	we can give ourselves something like this .
2150	the chef had cooked it .
815	we have to get far , very quickly .
2257	how will they feed the world ? &quot;
2041	that &apos;s going to take place in the next april .
6328	we expect a couple of extraordinary decades .
1233	i see the dalmatiner .
1242	what does 25 milliseconds of funding take ?
144	they are the home countries of somebody .
243	these are the mobile phones of the future .
3968	they had a concept of blue blood .
4295	tempt is now completely paralyzed .
2940	it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
6681	they tapped their internet connection .
6680	but today we are far beyond that .
5394	i believed everybody could .
2214	he &apos;d shake his head , no .
4689	we talk about bold , fresh .
4184	so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
3674	sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
1532	the one that &apos;s just been shown .
4367	make it possible -- all of you here .
4115	let me tell you a little bit about this .
2990	and why ? genetically modified food .
3258	daniel kahneman : sure .
3886	we &apos;ll come back to these guys later .
5804	so there &apos;s a feedback .
6745	so littlebits is open source .
6690	it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
3335	and there are some collaborators there .
5128	and i &apos;d like to read it to you .
2684	if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
2821	does anybody know what that is ?
2216	this is an ecological network .
1952	you place that ne box .
449	we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
740	this is an annual river of water .
6038	i think our identity is threatened .
2976	we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
4780	i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
69	now this level of intuition becomes very important .
2758	they run the process , they understand it .
5724	the next step has happened within these communities .
4359	it &apos;s all coming out of our own bags .
5913	my cousins were all around .
6538	it was a grouper .
3927	in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
2207	bad ? i was completely confused .
6479	alone , shame and no support .
4062	i mean , what am i going to find today ?
5216	he just wanted to share a rainbow .
6101	i get tired of how we all do .
175	now let &apos;s pull something else out .
6066	i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
2627	again , it should contain the two elements .
6501	sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
4147	and anyway , italy won at the end .
3862	but the game is a formal transducer .
6063	do you want to get there and listen ? &quot;
4259	as an artist , i &apos;m very important in the context .
4305	normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
19	a language is the expression of the human mind .
2688	this is just an insurance method .
1331	shake the environment , make less waste .
3134	he &apos;d had 20 minutes of glorious music .
3097	what does this look like ? pretty good .
5835	it can know how we hold it .
3266	we get an absolutely flat line above that .
3285	thank you , danny kahneman .
420	it &apos;s a little virus that &apos;s killing bacteria .
3924	we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
1998	and here you can see the whole thing again .
1827	because now you can apply a three-sentence .
5891	we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
1637	his personal impressions of the seeroses .
5985	many of my clients are very young .
2899	the guy in the middle is not so much .
3001	because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
4961	there &apos;s another thing about history .
5530	this is a modest little app .
2806	there has never been a time like this before .
4132	it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
5134	well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
6556	they grew five inches .
5155	here are two different jewelry facilities .
4152	you see the timeline on the top .
3505	but it &apos;s not just about the words .
768	but we start to see a change .
2573	and then what do you do with the waste ?
2634	there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
4607	the goal of the whole film is transparency .
6516	what you need is a new medical culture .
1783	a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
1300	i &apos;m going to try this through an example .
1240	it &apos;s just to process it as a presence .
5012	i have it on my laptop here . &quot;
1822	and then he can just walk away .
4656	all of a cool whip eats .
3096	well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
1463	imagine mozart efficient .
1953	and then it usually looks like this .
1529	so , help me with that a little bit .
6341	it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
382	they make us worse standing there .
5369	my mother called me a couple of minutes later .
892	so , that was my primary motivation .
5479	we asked around , and nobody knew .
4082	monday : color is a little more powerful .
1540	do you remember the windle again ?
4711	man 3 : i &apos;m the chief guy .
1454	or take a lip pen .
888	i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
1711	now , the instruments have evolved .
752	the amounts of water have expanded .
4157	second half time . end of normal play time .
4886	that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
4247	that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
1015	now , what are the archaic models ?
2541	if you burn natural gas , no .
1301	you know , everybody &apos;s eaten pies .
2540	if you burn coal , no .
2148	it &apos;s kind of made us sale .
1891	you say , there &apos;s no previous speakers .
103	and the problem is not the technology itself .
899	and you can endlessly continue the list .
2982	you know , science is not a company .
4240	it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
1828	three , you still know about school .
5215	in fact , no viral video wanted to make .
1098	i &apos;ll just explain that for a second .
209	yeah . it doesn &apos;t do anything else but it &apos;s discovering .
1833	in this three-sentence , three sentences come forward .
579	it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
230	this is my supermarket . it &apos;s not a big one .
6587	the difference is then perceived as a loss .
786	this is one , part of it .
4337	thank you very much , that was incredible .
237	in other areas , the world of communication .
5218	he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
3046	so , it &apos;s here . right .
4412	two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
2610	that really solves the fuel problem .
2165	and ecologically , it was a catastrophe .
6677	but western governments are also helping themselves .
1048	but i &apos;ll talk to that in a second .
4231	this is roberto dancing .
4587	this , by the way , is just the workforce .
3254	thank you . i have a question for you .
5901	she was the daughter of a slave family .
5963	this country is different than 40 years ago .
2631	there are a lot of great books about this .
6420	the emergency staff moved all the strands .
6318	so far , this was a supercomputer problem .
1229	and so on , now you &apos;re always seeing him .
1575	so basically a translation of translation .
4333	no insurance can make it comfortable .
2641	what kind of scores do i appeal to ?
2528	it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
2474	so what can we get out of all this ?
2756	you can predict that . why is that ?
2506	does it not reach half or a quarter ? &quot;
1380	no tree is carbon neutral .
1501	in two hours , it builds everywhere .
35	you just listen , and then you start talking .
6543	we &apos;re still thinking they &apos;re primal .
6403	i remember it as though it was yesterday .
5360	life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries .
4211	but the reality is always unpredictable .
2950	and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
1107	and the two last ones are here today .
5283	my grandmother never let me forget his life .
220	the official dogma of what ?
671	if you don &apos;t , somebody else &apos;s jellyfish today .
5413	and let me show you a simple example .
522	this is the machine underneath geneva .
2809	my parents are the 80 on the ferences .
1045	now , if you think about a little bit further .
6161	there &apos;s a chance to do something .
5497	i work in the solar technology industry .
5929	i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
6132	well , i walked into the courthouse .
6412	the three words were : do you remember ?
2972	we reject genetically modified food .
2299	you can dive into a particular year .
425	they laughed more than it does here .
1359	because that &apos;s evidence , right ?
3754	it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
4092	thursday : confidence is the key .
4827	you get in two ways -- very simple .
5021	it involves mosquitos a thousand square kilometers .
2818	we forced them . puff .
3685	i tried to preserve the body .
2337	we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
3687	i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
2123	&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
701	and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
6313	it &apos;s a game called foldit .
6257	we &apos;re thinking today about energy scarcity .
1259	that &apos;s more the norm than that .
4404	imagine a plane full of smoke .
3421	people were suffering . people were fighting .
1705	can you play it in blue now ?
2409	so , that really blew my mind .
3627	raise your hands . let me see you .
3146	and let &apos;s start with one example .
4555	you just have to spread it as far as possible .
3882	just imagine that for a moment .
3503	unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
3560	maybe we can see the odds as change .
4847	you can zoom in and out very easily .
1516	no , we find what &apos;s inside .
6713	let me show you how they work .
1332	shake the environment , use less energy .
5397	but it has an unexpected twist .
5167	my fourth technology : predictions of complexity .
1228	now you see the dalmatiner .
2300	you can jump directly to a particular output .
331	third , escalation of expectations .
4697	you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
6549	i thought i could integrate .
4027	i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
4144	the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
1312	and there &apos;s a central point here .
6293	i call it &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
806	new feeding america . find out more .
4830	you go around and amuse yourself .
3910	they are in the back part of our body .
569	yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
4694	and this is a million-dollar company .
4746	eeeeee ! no , thank you .
3343	i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
6317	and this is very important in medical science .
5176	motors , motors -- four possibilities .
6128	then he whispered me to the ear .
4520	so again , that fit really well together .
1323	the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
5636	we are more than that , we are citizens .
2689	you hope we don &apos;t need that .
4515	so that made sense , it fit together .
1113	anyway , you do that in there .
2993	it &apos;s kind of like a potato potato .
4892	this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
717	and yet , if not , dance your dance .
3101	let me show you it from near .
6166	what would you tell somebody who believes that ?
2988	shame . shame .
2020	and over time , they can react to another .
6640	this is alfred gonzalez .
2510	this has to go down , down to zero .
2152	amazingly , he was still delicious .
6190	and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
3116	there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
4542	so this is where we need digital security systems .
5444	and here &apos;s every piece being planned very well .
2642	we need to use more research funds .
6589	there can be a sequence of changes .
5443	and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
597	oh , jesus , what a thought !
3061	what ? it really freaked me out .
5975	yet , we seem to be quite pleased with this .
2477	it &apos;s the most powerful human attribute .
5810	we &apos;re in the middle of this transition dot .
3896	intersexuality happens in many different forms .
2364	but i didn &apos;t let myself feel discouraged .
5373	my mother asked us to grab her hand .
873	now i &apos;m going to add a bass .
377	the problem is they have too little .
5266	no one has to give light to your ideas .
729	the permanent ice is covered in red .
466	the new chromosome went into the cell .
5148	third technology : categorization .
5325	but that &apos;s how many people got help over the years .
1290	this is what &apos;s called the osit-model .
4394	it was something we knew to do .
3766	that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
2585	and there &apos;s the recovery problem .
3650	we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
2856	they were just like the people in this room .
1946	and yeah , i &apos;ll go on another slide again .
6664	what do you do with certificate ?
6022	we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
3821	so put it on . save the shoes .
2968	we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
5332	i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
5135	i think i may have heard more hands .
559	seriously , let &apos;s face it .
1958	our goal was to just say , okay .
1520	but all that &apos;s inside is useful .
5585	scott was talking about human beings to human .
233	so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
5405	is it all about the details , or the colors ?
6601	the question is , why do people accept this ?
543	and they had to remove what we did .
3931	so we have this horrible simplistic idea .
5916	i first thought that was a game .
2225	and they fly back 240 kilometers every night .
1479	that &apos;s where each footprint is disadvantaged .
4916	i mean , no one &apos;s ever seen a particle .
2765	what do you think happened to these design students ?
5455	it &apos;s got a button , on .
2315	now i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
6105	then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
3828	ladies and gentlemen , their relationship .
4036	that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
2440	they live with the help of chemosynthesis .
6254	it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
437	we just signed at the beginning .
4952	the rest of the time , they &apos;re delocated .
4618	what do you think the answer will be ?
2914	and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
2224	they fly to the farm for 240 kilometers every morning .
3284	thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
5785	and try it again with another generation .
4635	no one wanted to do something with the film .
4736	it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
5230	well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
4280	on the left-hand side you see a little boat .
2195	what is the food processing ? &quot;
3045	there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back there who didn &apos;t have childhood .
4693	these things have a more positive effect .
2792	we pretend that we have a machine here .
3610	the teacher didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
6717	that &apos;s how you can &apos;t get them wrong .
468	this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
327	now , this cartoon does some statements .
2189	it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
3880	so two pairs , one baby every time .
1753	picasso replies , just wait .
545	they &apos;re all back on their way now .
3308	it was almost beyond the imagination .
4757	the first one is a classic , apple .
6405	and i went back to work .
3108	now i would normally take the needle out .
2808	my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
1350	this is going to be balanced in china in a second .
3452	what we want is to create the future .
317	here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
2547	the internet and its service is a miracle .
6212	and we &apos;re continuing to increase our expectations .
1522	all of this is composable .
2625	this becomes a key element of this stuff .
2971	i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
2006	natural light then offers smart-grid .
5466	next week , this is on the market .
5562	today , a lot of people have given up to the government .
1963	no one in the world has done that .
6689	it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
316	but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
1165	that ecology is a global issue .
2347	i was totally thrilled with science , you know .
874	now i &apos;m going to do something else about this .
4814	but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
3696	it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
5838	the telling of storytelling always uses more senses .
1881	these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
3010	anyway . i certainly want that .
1535	technical cycles are the same .
4142	it came out in italy four and a half years ago .
5979	there are some very interesting developments .
1343	and everything is packaging or content .
5398	and yet , it still holds a realistic level .
5948	i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
4548	and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
1492	so not saving , quoting , avoiding .
4352	and we still need to make a lot better at this device .
486	it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
4642	in fact , no , it wasn &apos;t the error at all .
1614	so each concert is a different concert .
2576	i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
2007	so , smart-grid , a huge topic everywhere .
2276	instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
6085	in my work , i learned very simple things .
265	we don &apos;t invent identity , we invent it .
6453	it was a lot going on , and i was in eile .
1837	i particularly picked it up here .
1147	in the beginning , the tribal society is through language .
3616	come , dance with me . thank you .
1824	so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to the human .
642	that would roll across the country .
1222	now everybody from this pattern is trying to see something .
6127	he came to me and hugged me .
4097	and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
3412	but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
5689	all of the ones that were like this started to divide .
3087	i &apos;m really sorry . does she do that crazy ?
322	i could park right outside my house . &quot;
5605	that our contribution to the system is the vote .
3316	this is a problem that a lot of players have .
4229	i &apos;d like to show you something first .
4789	he hasn &apos;t yet come out in other countries .
6348	do you know how to call a 400ter ?
4426	i don &apos;t want to make a difference in life .
5911	my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
4446	i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
4869	now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
2296	it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
2885	what happened is we could do that .
399	we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
4860	the best one is still -- in a second .
827	i start with some simple examples .
5833	at 16 , i started illustrating books .
6130	and i have to say , there was power .
6520	it support when others talk about their mistakes .
3579	and then , of course , it made click .
6686	and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
6386	i hired them , and i went to the treatment .
6744	and we want to make this material available for everyone .
5090	so the issue of the day is , financial saving .
6221	notice two things about this curve .
2737	they don &apos;t invest time in power fights .
3572	it was summer , and i had shorts .
3531	and i say that that &apos;s good .
2124	&quot; great , &quot; i said . i set up .
1511	for example , the sneaker , yes ?
4313	so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
4308	that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers walk along .
5342	there had to be another piece of puzzle .
2936	why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
6076	we want to do something about death penalty .
333	i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
6675	the corporate headquarters are right here .
6508	all of these are inevitable .
5919	i remember it was yesterday .
1686	but maybe you can still agree with them .
3885	both of them are survivable , both of them .
3775	as i said , amanda is carrying our elephant .
2987	this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
6324	we have access to exponential technologies .
2154	i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
5983	the silence is ear anesthetic .
6280	and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
1940	we already have 20 percent in germany .
5329	i was not familiar with the label .
6595	so you don &apos;t often lose pre-occurring animals .
849	so for him , they were just building blocks .
2966	we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
1437	and we see that it &apos;s going through .
1431	that means we need to get phosphorus back .
4350	this is something like our cry .
2772	now you understood the advantage of the prototyping .
789	in fact , coal is not dirty .
2217	the flamingos eat the shrimp .
5142	because it doesn &apos;t really feel like we &apos;re feeling money .
4234	so you can make the whole movement .
3941	and it &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
846	here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
5334	i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
3205	there seems to be a disagreement .
6599	they get more rare because we catch them .
6470	one of the things i thought he had was kidney stones .
6574	this is a dead turtle .
2964	there were no cantaloupees .
774	you &apos;ve seen it in the news , apparently .
1164	we understood that the weather is global .
1543	in the countries where people come to money .
4112	i have something i want to show you .
760	this is a completely unsustainable pattern of development .
459	it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
1780	so , we can &apos;t have these things at all .
5777	hold those off , delete the rest .
3621	what would it be like to live longer with good health ?
2385	and i found this incredibly exciting .
1177	and what does it actually look like in there ?
1039	and in that head , the memory occurred .
321	everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
2975	we don &apos;t want companies to patented lives .
4713	so i think that &apos;s my brand .
2169	they &apos;ve reversed the flow of the water .
1542	everywhere , these tiles are all around , almost .
6380	and to give back to my supreme doctor .
4673	i want to help you calm down .
6077	we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
5611	people seem to think , politics is sexy .
5584	but what happened to citizens &apos; citizens &apos; &quot; is different .
4778	and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
4703	all right , what is the brand gerry ?
2927	did you take all your vitamins this morning ?
2435	so this was a very strange experience .
5709	the defeat of dna was an interesting step .
5297	no apple has ever tapped that way again .
1185	information is every difference that makes a difference .
1038	the only thing they had was their head .
5843	and out of me , a character in the book .
2909	and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
6366	i was an obsessive student .
3068	... that the doses also matter .
3220	it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
1745	he &apos;s just deceiving you and not yourselves .
2896	this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
1897	because actually , this person is not interested in evidence at all .
4801	and finally , we should welcome transparency .
2274	it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
6385	and that was not a hard diagnosis to do .
1550	it &apos;s sort of a behavioral poop print .
6583	if you generate it , here &apos;s what happens .
3710	how could it be possible that we do that ?
1626	and in my youth , i said , expectation .
2978	yeah , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
5899	she had the last word in every family argument .
1977	well , that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
3176	and you say , what happens to these moments ?
1643	because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
6347	all right , really good , maybe a all-star .
1036	or they didn &apos;t have photography .
3401	that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
4469	and that &apos;s the planning behind stuxnet .
5213	in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
3451	we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
456	this is a 6 seconds &apos; worth of footage .
4422	i learned that , in one moment , everything is different .
2719	the marshmallow has to be on top .
4669	so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
2886	well , i understand that . i do .
5678	the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
5411	so i think the essentials are very simple .
2488	today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
4019	but how do you do that in practice ?
4637	they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
4585	do you know how many people are watching these tedtalks ?
4619	the answer will be very likely &quot; no . &quot;
2813	think about it . this is an incredible fact .
1469	if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
5693	so each droplet was slightly different .
6625	in our own countries , we would never do that .
4174	here are the results that we just got .
2613	this is what the u.s. is doing for hundreds of years .
5458	i did my job at 95 kilos .
2476	i think the first place is curiosity .
4571	because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
1509	but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
1505	it &apos;s not all supposed to be composable , of course .
3692	i want to do it by not die . &quot;
889	yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
5331	i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
5576	and that worked . applause for scott .
4733	what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
1652	interpretation is barely spoken in the beginning class .
3588	see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
5591	good night , sweet thylacines . &quot;
5260	and that all leads to the one big question ...
185	there are some that are much more spatial .
5782	say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
4944	we found that it &apos;s really , really , really strange .
3217	what are the emotions that can be measured ?
3209	well , would you choose the same vacation ?
1975	these were the very first computation six years ago .
1935	and the question is , why don &apos;t they have them anymore ?
190	and we can navigate in this very simple way .
4859	here we were , and this is the painting .
6325	we have the passion of a diy innovator .
3160	but one of them is much worse than the other .
6435	this is the kind of educational shame .
5569	this is the call center for service and information .
3872	but are we going to make the best part of our game drive ?
6530	i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
5133	you know , it was a trick , right ?
5132	all right , let me show you some more of that .
1081	from the avian age to the machine age .
4528	it &apos;s soundscape , and it &apos;s just sooner .
5416	but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
2098	i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
3371	you expect another billion players in the next decade .
287	and the world that we lived in looked like this .
1220	i don &apos;t know who knows this picture from you .
6597	and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a huge loss .
6078	we want to eliminate mass incarceration . &quot;
3989	we see the same thing with the disability movement .
4435	it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
5894	and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
2422	and so i came up with a slightly unusual choice .
951	yeah , what are we doing now for projects ?
6220	this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
5473	we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
4805	emc : &quot; welcome transparency . &quot;
5821	now we do this with drillers and machines .
4750	there were a lot of crazy things going on .
2307	you do something that &apos;s actually slightly different .
3473	8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
5609	and we use this word with deforestation .
6419	she hardly breathed and walked blue .
5974	fortune , not debt , the result influences .
4881	and that was an experience in humility for me .
3038	probably many of you in the room know this trick .
2616	let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
360	but defeat is not always such a bad thing .
2455	these silly films don &apos;t bring us any money .
4786	this is just online -- no press , no television .
1733	why do i have to afford a little car like this ?
4266	every iceberg has its own individual personality .
2175	i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
1778	because without these lists , we can &apos;t live .
3978	they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
2946	and i have all kinds of little props here .
2620	it &apos;s really important that we get there .
4592	you know , i had the idea for a movie .
856	now he &apos;s going to put a tractor in the scene .
5354	i made the decision to go to the united states .
832	and they also feel their movements and their affection .
6178	thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
3372	so we all have 1.5 billion players .
1110	the whole thing is a game , i have to say to that .
542	so we complained about 50 of the magnets .
715	if your job is dancing , dance .
2379	so my two passions sort of flared .
5587	and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
878	i can reframe the sequence as it runs .
4763	or are they more like a down-attribute ?
1667	create a phrase with its own breath .
2077	for nathaniel , music means mental health .
4473	i want to tell you how we figured that out .
2464	there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
5316	my mother suffered from the boat &apos;s alpine dreams .
1845	the logic doesn &apos;t make a point about reality .
4729	these are the people that shape my worldview .
3947	we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
1619	have a nice concrete example of this .
266	and we &apos;re reinventing ourselves as often as we want .
4419	i didn &apos;t have to talk to the board staff anymore .
6397	maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
192	i &apos;m very grateful for the receivation here .
2697	the main problem here is something like aids .
2981	it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
6534	you know , he was here in 1835 .
5801	and yet we don &apos;t really understand the possibility of it .
1490	then i say , heartfelt sorry , yes ?
4523	these results have been achieved hard work for several weeks .
3607	and it was the same after the three months .
2594	in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
3310	this player is about to be an epic victory .
2519	probably one of those numbers has to be very close to zero .
5642	you could just show the slide for a second .
5888	you can say things that have a global impact here .
6064	and i said , &quot; yeah , very much . &quot;
3427	likewise , i think we &apos;re entering games today .
4971	at the moment , we &apos;re far from that goal .
5170	i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
2454	why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
6067	and i went over , and i just listened .
2029	now , luckily , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
4862	another favorite picture of me , star night .
5856	it also shows itself in other places of the book .
3	we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
5489	and we want to put this on a global level .
4601	it was &quot; eternity , forever . &quot;
5439	the underwater part comes from a quarry .
3411	i &apos;m just listening , that &apos;s logical .
2801	i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
2967	and some of it worked and some didn &apos;t .
210	if you want it to create hyperlinks between the images .
2989	they need it , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
3100	people in the side rooms are coming in now .
5845	the child in me is really enthusiastic about those possibilities .
3091	but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
6312	there &apos;s a program that some might know .
2942	so we go away from that , and where do we go ?
5529	so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
2763	i thought we &apos;d put the poker effort in the same way .
1031	they &apos;re virtualizing reality without computers .
851	we wanted to develop a tool for language learners .
2840	but you know what you &apos;re not right about ?
5400	when i say reality , i mean photoreality .
4085	tuesday : adaptation is totally overrated .
6044	i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
3799	the dog ! i was nowhere near envy .
247	now you know what the answer to this question is ?
594	i may have another 40 years of work in me .
4743	a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
4782	and how was that for you ? what was it successful ?
5517	al is a hydrant in boston city .
1445	but you &apos;re not going to be able to replace phosphorus .
5496	today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
1366	the first question is , are we really too many ?
3620	do you want to become more attractive and more confident ?
5991	the death penalty question is an interesting question .
3849	in doing so , we learn trust and the rules of the game .
4484	and if it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not doing anything .
3301	this is one of the classic expressions of play .
3976	they moved to a natural concept .
4935	look , let me give you an analogy .
2921	we didn &apos;t have children &apos;s paralysis in this country yesterday .
3644	this is another look at the tree of life .
5485	and we &apos;ve created an ipad app .
3699	the first is we &apos;re not going to develop .
6088	i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
3128	there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
5273	i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
4549	think about it . this attack is generic .
2842	and i spent some time trying to figure that out .
5320	lens and sponsors were seeded .
1047	then you &apos;ll notice that there has been a change .
4824	you can look around in all these museums here .
4418	he says , &quot; ready to jump . &quot;
4416	think about a noisy aircraft .
2770	we repeated this exercise with the same students .
2205	&quot; look at your stomach , pink .
3433	they divided the kingdom into two containers .
1022	and the third area , which actually explains itself .
4470	so we start with a windows dropper .
673	his whole work process changed after that .
6206	child mortality has decreased by a tenth .
5536	so he got the citizens to check them .
163	every big picture is the beginning of a section .
6061	so these women just met , and they just talked .
1382	there &apos;s no overpopulation problem in trees .
5757	the more it changes , the faster it changes .
4614	how much money is needed to realize this ?
886	i &apos;m looking forward to everybody &apos;s conversations .
4196	we called it the digital water pavilion .
1702	so please listen when a music is played .
3630	how many would decide for a good memory ?
2103	it &apos;s hard to overestimate the destruction .
5048	this is an idea worth spreading .
5161	well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
6748	so , go out and start inventing it .
1121	and we can look at that now .
6488	it &apos;s a totally denial of errors .
791	so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
2011	and that &apos;s how n bikes is the message .
3730	so just imagine two other small changes .
1849	the logic doesn &apos;t make a point about what &apos;s true .
2757	because they have special skills in the process companion .
1843	the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
5792	these are versions and strange programs .
2525	the second factor is the services we use .
5922	i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
672	go and queue leonard cohen .
1369	that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
2558	so here are some natural fireflies .
2097	so you could feel like you could sell him .
2471	it changed my way of making films completely .
4630	there are some places that we can turn to .
5564	politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
1823	that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
4645	but what this image represents is a problem .
1861	we can continue these things on different examples .
1091	what we &apos;ve stayed with is storytelling .
1793	once you do that , and then you get the sentence .
936	this shouldn &apos;t be a joke , actually .
1807	in fact , we know that something else is the case .
4767	are you eight and months , like 007 ?
3925	so gender can occur in many different varieties .
6537	he described one of them as very common .
1178	so how do we work when we look in there ?
3332	they never get a task they can &apos;t solve .
1732	and at all , you did a lot less than i did .
1262	and less usable or usable , it &apos;s friendly .
3384	as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
2943	we &apos;re going into the arms of the placebo industry .
1689	i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
741	but volume is much bigger than ever .
2493	so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
3151	and here are two patients . these are their records .
618	everybody knew your genius was a little smart .
433	you may have heard that we &apos;ve put in watermarks .
3852	play is the tickle that holds us together .
5548	and there are projects like this at every level of government .
3417	and these were , in a way , the first people developed toys .
6314	it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
5063	i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
5232	but what about that day , that particular friday ?
3267	i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
5615	so the occupathetic movement has done it .
173	but these are all the streets in the united states .
6581	we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
3512	wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors to them ?
4080	you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
2992	now , maniok is something that eats half a billion people .
1615	i will never play more like that moment .
1216	that &apos;s there , then that comes back .
3617	how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
4866	you zoomed in . you can actually go inside .
6459	and she said the three words : do you remember ?
5771	so in other words , i define what i want first .
3597	they teach them to open themselves doors .
5418	and i see the same process in combining photographs .
57	we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
1238	so , it &apos;s also always interesting to know as designers .
727	it grows in the winter and shrunk in summer .
544	we reacted them , repaired them .
2694	those who make scientific argument are very little .
5282	but our lives are so much more than our memories .
3127	i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
4253	you can move inside and have different kinds of experiences .
793	clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
4734	next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
3817	if you have something to give , you &apos;re going to give it now .
5079	they had 348 different kinds of markers .
2486	you have to be willing to take risks like this .
4919	i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
2325	i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
4441	i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
5910	the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
4537	in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
289	and the world that we live in now looks like this .
3495	antony me : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
4463	we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
4089	wednesday : hug your inner child .
2997	you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
4766	or are they more like a down-attriangle ?
4557	this is the consequence that we have to ask ourselves .
679	not just bad , but the worst of all time .
5226	it &apos;s been looked at almost 200 million times this year .
2984	it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
3783	he &apos;s got five hopes out of my consciousness .
1513	because we don &apos;t make things freely off .
6566	we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
5730	and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
850	this is an interactive tricko turn .
304	paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
2080	i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
6649	in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
4668	and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever built . &quot;
3489	so i say , let the world-changing games start !
4193	well , we introduced the mayor belhole .
2298	with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
2253	but for many people , that &apos;s a little too radical .
4168	well , today we know everything about where our stuff comes from .
599	i would continue to do this work that i love .
687	i &apos;m still going to continue writing , because that &apos;s my job .
4459	how would you change your relationships , and the negative energy in it ?
6240	30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
2481	and i say , &quot; don &apos;t shake yourself .
2678	bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important .
4496	we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
5577	but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacines .
3643	is it money for others , or is it also for us ?
3832	now , chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
5593	this is great . this is where digital meets the physical .
5037	again , urban designers and construction are very interested .
3289	we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online .
4788	it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not streaming .
5650	this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
4155	france is a tor . it &apos;s a tor .
3052	i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
3502	here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
718	and eight-year-olé ! it &apos;s true for you .
228	and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
829	and these interactive portraits come true .
2665	where is the biggest interest in doing this really ?
3192	the living self has no voice in that choice .
3422	it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
2425	we returned to the titanic wreck .
2977	and you know what my answer to all this is ?
499	we &apos;re now focusing on the fuels of the fourth generation .
1496	it &apos;s a refour-like shape , right ?
3905	she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
201	you get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
1678	or b , because you haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
5010	the audience faces were very serious and alert .
2680	in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
6129	he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
4798	we should put the bear in the cage .
4559	they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
4391	well , the next day we were in cleveland .
4159	zidane , in a moment of the head shoe .
3827	and no , it &apos;s not burning you or san francisco .
4753	and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
4452	and in the world , everything made sense for me .
4849	i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
1756	because artists have a disrupted relationship to lying .
5877	in one place , the screen &apos;s filled with leaves .
1146	every society is predetermined by a primary medium .
5242	this year , it &apos;s been viewed almost 50 million times .
1260	how can i make something that &apos;s possible to use kindness ?
129	the grandfather of this old man &apos;s grandfather refused .
2494	and also , the energy cycle is very important for you .
442	we tried to get to the point of automation .
6661	now , how do people die in the course of one of these hacks ?
3103	that &apos;s my flesh , and i can turn that around .
3902	so a lot of testosterone , but not a response to that .
1104	these are spaces that are smart to respond to a human being .
3186	that &apos;s not how the memory itself works at all .
2751	one meter is the highest one i &apos;ve seen .
1474	no , throwing away is exactly the right thing , right ?
2592	a manhattan project ? how do we get here ?
6476	both cases naked to me , they asked me .
195	many of them are covered by faces and so on .
4712	i sell scores all over the country , globally .
6533	the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
4925	and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
2401	that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
3028	i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my lap .
4823	so you just go to google project.com .
6506	i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same way .
1830	this , by the way , is the hardest part of my talk .
4868	this is star night , probably never seen that before .
709	when we start thinking about it this way , it changes everything .
2450	in the course of this exploration journey , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
2375	as a child , i constantly made comic books and stuff .
1616	i can &apos;t play that in 20 years today .
6475	in both cases , they had surgery , and they did well .
1337	that &apos;s why thinking about the weighs to weighs .
2416	i was pretty much obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
1852	so when klaus says there &apos;s no soul .
6591	now that &apos;s largely what we &apos;re going to do .
2619	many speak of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
5939	we were just kind of silly around there .
1137	a research semester about natural user interface design .
1570	in fact , the notes are very vague and very insecure .
5841	it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
1199	there &apos;s more to my glasses there .
614	and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
3184	the biggest difference between them is the transition with time .
4020	how do you judge people from their traits ?
5330	i didn &apos;t know how to use the brick .
6540	now he &apos;s on the red list of dangerous species .
1001	as i said , it just started out two thousand .
2091	so i used to know a lot of fish in my life .
5484	the next step was to find the apps for this .
5725	the cell community started to abstract information again .
4503	now , in this area , there are not several thousand targets .
4675	and then we offer one of these great dunes .
5365	&quot; it &apos;s not &quot; proven to be untrue .
5272	it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
5811	but i really believe that after us there &apos;s something else .
3402	edward castronova is a economist .
290	and the question is , are these good news or bad news ?
2185	he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
3024	i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
387	you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish glass . &quot;
4079	you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
6226	so the growth rate itself is speeding up .
5476	we know another one where all the gas stations are .
1130	i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there .
4744	what other metamorphosis do they go through ?
6175	i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
6513	they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
2588	it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
4682	so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
3341	this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
412	our steps in digitizing life were exponential .
3012	we can put this time machine on everything we want .
1495	because , you know , this is a fun process .
6224	it doesn &apos;t slow down for any of our big problems .
3767	and this is indeed a conservative estimate .
6602	well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
1221	there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
5500	here &apos;s a short video of what we &apos;re doing .
4538	the idea is to overlift a digital security system .
506	this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
2497	in fact , the progression society is based on energy progress .
12	the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
1375	have you seen a climate-neutral tree ?
6700	it &apos;s called the automatically committed stone .
6301	what are they going to consume ? what are they going to desire ?
812	america &apos;s new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
5424	but together they can create something special like this .
780	frosty , the carbon man gets cleaner every day .
5759	we see the process that feeds itself .
2944	that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
5138	because the pictures made it real for them .
814	if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
5589	thylacines ? yes . alive ? yap .
6662	diginotar is a certification spot .
5419	it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
6268	he took a famous photograph . what did it mean ?
2177	i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with miguel .
168	or other models , or even technical specifications .
4828	click , and wum , you &apos;re in this museum .
2960	it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
3025	and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
2408	this was not a movie , not a hd , that was real .
2820	diphy , rotelene , child paralysis ...
4207	but actually , that night , it was an even bigger fun .
6037	and yet , there &apos;s this mental disconnection .
4575	i worked in a coal mining plant -- dangerous .
1188	and of course , the way design takes influence on perception .
1425	that means you &apos;re going to go back to criminal rates .
5736	it could happen within a time-time learning framework .
6426	she had suffered a non-treatable brain damage .
5499	... it &apos;s given to crowdsourcing .
1627	that &apos;s where he smelled and said , &quot; what ? &quot;
6422	they hired it to the cat machine .
5387	i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
2866	i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
2709	for the lower two billion but it &apos;s a disaster .
521	it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
4718	lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
1252	so , how does a human being deal with certain things ?
1087	we have an abstract language , abstract language .
1468	all that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
5883	this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
1170	just as it used to happen in the village .
4170	but we just know a little bit about where things go .
4966	there &apos;s more to it , there &apos;s even deeper .
6234	it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
6560	and the fish was also lucky to be there .
3094	i know what people think when they see that .
3375	ok , think of this as extreme self-motivating .
2133	i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
2868	ask , ask the evidence , demand the evidence .
770	however , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
1072	this is what &apos;s happened . this is what &apos;s called the machine age .
6169	it was the misled crossroads against drugs .
1101	another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
6712	a few years ago , i started developing live life .
1640	he lived only nine years .
4832	open the map , and jump with a click .
3119	and my talk today is going to be mostly about these cognitive falling .
4378	one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
5671	what is this new condition that the world is beginning to stop ?
4215	imagine these pictures could really start to fly .
555	and i don &apos;t expect that this will ever change .
554	it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
3238	there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
2218	the shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
2267	this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
5423	as you can see , these are not three special images .
732	in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
2157	he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
3870	in other words , play is our adaptation joker .
348	and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
987	and i think technology will become more and more important in our modern societies .
5904	my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
4606	and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
3461	and i can tell you it was a change experience .
5211	ohhh , wowwww !
1051	and even today , we &apos;re still very , very strong in stories .
1348	a baby needs about six thousand diapers .
3405	and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
5960	my uncle died of alcohol industrialized diseases .
605	please follow me , because the circle will end again .
756	and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
4649	you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot about transparency right now .
1703	it &apos;s not just a nice soundscape .
2239	he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
2304	so i step back and i get the perspective further .
528	it caused huge levers in the control room .
5802	so , in a way , the technology is surplus us .
4487	so we should soon find out what the goal is .
4864	but what if you want to see the paintbrush strikes ?
187	we had to worry about lawyers and so on .
5404	but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
4576	i filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
997	so i know from some that didn &apos;t carry in .
1917	but it wasn &apos;t like that in the &apos; 70s .
1973	and then they set up a whole bunch of simulations .
6544	the barriers still describe them as untouched .
5898	she was a gun , strong woman , she had an effect .
2403	we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
2864	you can just call a couple of names , and people will understand .
2418	and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
4815	there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
994	it &apos;s quite a substantial number of people around the world .
2668	this is a variant of one thing that &apos;s been done .
4126	when we make cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
3728	can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
2496	well , the energy cycle has dropped over time .
3150	they were asked to cover their pain every 60 seconds .
625	it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
1668	the music instrument is really the extension of our body .
5959	my grandfather was in prison during the prohibition .
2079	and so he escapes his agonizing conditions .
5442	i always start with a sketch , an idea .
3904	when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
4178	we can actually do the same things with less energy .
2234	it &apos;s this voracious , inexpensive taste .
1526	hey , puma , are you really serious ?
2858	but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s face it .
5426	secondly , combined photographs should have the same type of illumination .
4594	and the film will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever ever 1,000 . &quot;
1444	and the oil we &apos;re going to be able to replace with other energy carriers .
3807	i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
4852	and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
4749	yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
1720	and also , what you would think today in the mind .
6144	ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
572	like algae -- and other terrible things .
280	i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
1734	and then i can immediately think , this is unfair .
3112	i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
6326	we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
2247	the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
216	blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heartfelt congratulations .
5314	my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
3000	i mean , let &apos;s ask : why are we fighting this ?
4054	i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
665	i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to do it .
2810	so there should be better a nine at the beginning of my death .
5457	and yeah , i &apos;ve got a job , as you might recognize .
2280	because they are the people who are also experts for taste .
3062	but it turns out it &apos;s not all .
231	i just want to talk briefly about salatdressing .
3858	just that i think it &apos;s more likely to him , right ?
2891	that &apos;s a lot of deaths from masses , 20 hours per hour .
2238	i mentioned this to miguel , and he was kidding .
4727	i have that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
6109	right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
6578	and then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
259	the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
1727	i have a friend who &apos;s driving a passerati .
6667	but you can do it if you go into a foreign foreign .
262	why do they advertise for us if we can &apos;t buy ?
2593	what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of companies .
4091	i smile and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
2087	bruno giussani : thank you . thank you . thank you .
4924	so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
6072	i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
2959	this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
3007	there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
5057	50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
3671	i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
3745	these are the kinds of questions that we have to face .
5602	let &apos;s call the creator , it costs a lot of money .
6736	we also brought littlips to design schools .
4554	you could also use common worm technology to spread .
5111	they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing space .
236	you have to admit that this is a huge choice .
3199	i mean , how much are we eating from our memories ?
5601	if one neighbor helps the other , we will strengthen our communities .
1345	and because we get older , the tiles get bigger .
2953	they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
6613	this is the simulation of the chesapeake bay .
4871	that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
2137	&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
4608	you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the movie of stats .
4914	well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
211	and it does this because of the content in the images .
1245	this is the time period that you fall in love with .
4917	but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
5720	in fact , we are such a multi-cellular community .
3413	we need to start turning the real world into a game .
4891	for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
5718	and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
4374	today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
694	and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be human anymore .
5622	a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
5056	each one of those themes , of course , were made out of many , many , many smaller decisions .
2288	and immediately i see a different pattern that comes out .
6118	a couple of months preceded , and i had just forgotten .
3379	players are masters in the spider of poet social nets .
619	so people in the west have spent a really long time thinking about creativity .
1460	that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
2700	the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worried .
4870	there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
6316	according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
5746	the invention of language , for example , was a little step in that direction .
4451	and i celebrate , i cry like a little child .
2421	so that got me really upset , and i wanted more .
4105	obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
3326	how can we transfer these feelings from play into reality ?
4926	this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about in a second .
2807	my great-grandparents all died when they were 60 .
3619	or do you want to be more fitter , have more power .
5999	an amazing error rate . one out of nine innocent .
3318	and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , even though that &apos;s part of it .
3053	this trick you can do to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
4084	if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
5339	and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell you .
240	and a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
6029	and of course , they can &apos;t be in germany anymore . &quot;
2773	so the same , bad team of one was the best .
254	b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
1955	yeah , this is what one looks like on the bottom is just the load .
6151	that all of our survival is connected to the survival of each individual .
1438	we &apos;ve now deployed in holland for three years .
457	this is the audience we just recently completed .
3249	well , your life itself is not going to become happier .
748	this is equivalent to 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
5375	&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding them for this morning , &quot; he said .
4356	since that time , we &apos;ve received all kinds of recognition .
6342	we &apos;re talking about a 300 if a bat hits 300 .
196	somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
6297	in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
6381	i studied a woman , a woman , printer , and she was breathtaking .
1073	we moved in what we call the avian age .
3177	and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
5850	and they went through the rest of the book .
5259	this approach applies to everything we do creatively .
3270	the more money you make , the more satisfied you are .
2611	here &apos;s a picture of an orange in kentucky .
2219	so the brusher , the better the system . &quot;
6373	and i was collecting more and more knowledge all the time .
2108	he &apos;s got a 15 to one food processing .
4267	they &apos;re definitely interacting with their environment and their experiences .
2963	you know , there were no mandarins in paradise .
5219	and this video was actually already sent in january .
6091	even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
5288	it was completely excluded that she could fail .
194	and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
4099	so there &apos;s no excuse for anybody in this audience .
6567	i know now that it was the cause of the sea .
1846	i can say , the kanzler is a man .
5962	i &apos;ve tried to say something about our system of justice .
2636	a very concrete wish that we are inventing this technology .
6431	and that &apos;s the first time i learned this .
2591	now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
4893	now , where would you position your brain at this scale ?
5542	the software &apos;s comprehension typically takes a few years .
4721	and what i found was that i needed an expert .
4448	i just wish i could see my children grow up .
6393	i sent her home without talking to my chief doctor .
5614	we need to engage in government &apos;s engine .
1645	now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
5613	because this is where the actual government work is happening .
6263	the cost of solar energy fell 50 percent in the last year .
305	and i think it makes the case that the world looks like this .
1208	the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is vision .
1459	all that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
5477	and sure , we can find fast food chains .
1436	we see that phosphorus is really critical .
2405	and i convinced her to fund an expedition .
5245	cats look at cats that look at this video .
3600	again , what potential do we want to call out ?
4069	so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
2939	and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
4947	so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what &apos;s really fantastic .
1947	the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
3953	if it didn &apos;t move , you &apos;ve buried it .
5806	because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
1536	there &apos;s a direct spinal cord system here .
3175	it has sight of life , one after another .
1600	i play explaining what these sounds might have to be .
2965	there were no christmas trees . we did all that .
4863	in the previous example , it was about finding details .
438	some people were disappointed that it was not a poetry .
312	secondly , what economists call the opposition cost .
4276	and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
5925	she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
3207	so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
1508	the things that are just being used go into technical systems .
2162	they did that by aiming the country .
796	but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
2336	we &apos;re talking about the flow of information .
5069	it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
6256	and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
5651	so , if you could do the light again .
1799	there &apos;s only the second best one , the fire department .
1500	they can throw them away where they &apos;re going and where they &apos;re going .
4799	welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
6561	so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything has changed .
6156	bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
4497	it looks pretty much like the old-fashioned assembly language .
3047	and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
1117	i apologize i have to cut so much .
1731	that already loses half his value in the first year .
1915	and in berlin there was a crazy engineering collection .
4672	are they there ? they look a little nervous .
1127	yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be with you .
6741	but wait , this is really my favorite project .
977	so this is the device that you see there that didn &apos;t work .
6295	we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
1853	secondly , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
1089	we &apos;ve been used to things that happen linear .
2996	and then people could eat that , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
6112	i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy as a client .
4833	in there they are , they want to get to the end of the gang .
6349	this is somebody who , by the way , is probably four out of 10 .
4278	very rarely you &apos;re actually witnessing a rolling iceberg .
1813	i want to present to you two , maybe three examples .
1346	they &apos;re all in the pre-wind phase , in a way .
2784	there &apos;s a step-by-step manual there .
4351	that keeps us going , and it keeps us evolving .
4623	so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
3111	we &apos;re going to meet another couple of times in the next few days .
2093	this first one , this was more like a passionate affair .
4436	i didn &apos;t strike me for two years with my wife .
3142	now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
680	i started thinking i should just enter the project .
4413	the pilot set out the machine after the hudson river .
416	it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
6014	it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
1447	and the first time is to ask , what is the right thing .
3132	what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
67	it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
4397	the revelation is that death is a part of life .
4204	you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
1895	he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived it .
6721	they put a blue one on a green one , and they can make light .
4238	i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
1699	because the music is a language , and a language is there to communicate .
3195	we think about our future as our foreseen memories .
5093	and what we found was that there was indeed a correlation .
6136	more and more people came in just because they were angry .
1131	but i &apos;m just going to make it a little bit curious .
5721	we have a lot of cells that are not on their own .
5429	make it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
6588	but you don &apos;t notice the previous losses .
4285	it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
5050	you know how many decisions do you make on a typical day ?
4569	so the driving force behind that is the cyberpower superpower .
5277	the words , as long as his friends , he now spoted .
5368	i knew she &apos;d come to say goodbye .
3887	in most of my activities , i have two hats .
790	we think it &apos;s clean -- and we &apos;re still smelling well .
1525	that &apos;s why they &apos;re helping with , ask for the people .
2286	the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
5051	you know how many decisions do you make in a typical week ?
5116	a typical wal-mart now offers you 100,000 products .
3198	and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
719	i think about it , and i feel we should teach it .
3716	wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
3624	which one would you like to have if it could only have one ?
4315	so they &apos;re moving around and doing art installations like this .
1103	and other examples are the ambitious , intelligent systems .
5890	i say that because i think identity is very important .
5795	because their life depended on whether they were doing the job right .
2478	our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
3446	i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
2128	he said he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
2200	depending on a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
2122	&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you feed ? &quot;
1979	and then we started negotiating with insulanders .
5251	today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do .
2278	look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
3356	so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
6409	i went home through the emergency department .
6423	i was shocked , and i was ripped inside .
1193	but also , our perception of ourselves , how deceived it is .
5560	and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
3261	if we looked at how feelings vary income .
1027	how many doors does the house in which they live ?
655	and i guess many of you have done that too .
4958	i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
2767	this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
6654	we have accidents like the diginotar one .
2956	please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
5478	but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
2932	they evaporate their urine . they almost never do .
6669	and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of diginotar .
4408	i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft companion .
5608	and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
783	the most powerful miner is the head of massey coal .
4431	but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
830	so when i put them next to each other , that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
1788	and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
5186	it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
1538	again , so in any store , you can get the things back .
6648	and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to get worse .
6529	let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
1059	and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
4113	think of this as a visual point , as a flying point of view .
3464	this is a fascinating adventure to go on .
2724	usually , most people start to orient themselves on the task .
782	this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
160	maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book .
2321	and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
5173	they have to make 62 different decisions to completely design their car .
2297	you can test it after my talk in your rooms .
4444	almost like we were preparing our lives for a long time .
4360	so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
3834	but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
3260	we found that in terms of the happiness of the heritage itself .
2698	you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
4522	now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go that way .
641	she said it was like a thunderous train out of air .
6571	these pictures are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
5826	i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
6542	yet , we &apos;re still in the galapagos islands .
4318	but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
5751	so now we &apos;ve removed the timeline .
255	and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
669	how do i look like i could just write a song ?
6608	because , through marine protected areas , we are basically restoring the past .
5528	if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away from you .
1907	but it &apos;s the sum , of course , of many ideas .
2539	the question is , can you get that to zero ?
3592	if you ask me today , i &apos;m not sure .
3236	we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
2144	this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
5595	but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
2221	it &apos;s a fish lift , but it &apos;s also a bird reserve .
6099	sometimes i lose the balance . i end up with a story .
5739	it &apos;s quite an amazing invention when you think about it .
481	i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to see what we need .
5596	and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
2888	does a single person in the audience ever see a maser die ?
3214	so you can ask : how happy is the life itself ?
6311	i want to end with a story that really excites me .
6635	and the motifs of online criminals are very easy to understand .
3179	most of them are completely ignored by the memory of themselves .
4839	when the museum gives us the picture , they click on it .
1342	we can , of course , look at the waste problem first .
5620	you have to introduce the huge challenges that they have to face .
1330	so , for example , the environment , the less driving car .
5749	so today , evolution can happen in the time span of microseconds .
1352	so the question is , how do we deal with these tiles ?
4951	it &apos;s only at precise times that they agree .
6050	innovation , creativity , development , it &apos;s not just coming out of our heads .
1934	they now have a renewable energy percentage of fifteen percent .
5552	and that means free access , which is open and productive .
1795	you feel that this is the actual truth behind the outcome .
6279	this is technological innovation that we have today .
3520	and if you do , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
4861	let &apos;s jump to moma , again in new york .
2664	but as you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these opportunities .
2181	now he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
3121	the first one of these falls is a contradiction to admit complexity .
1285	the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
1349	we could , of course , reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
1503	that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
3913	we produce androgen , and we talk about androgens .
6286	and the best part is possibly what &apos;s going to happen to us in health .
3830	bonobos are our closest living relatives with chimpanzees .
5519	how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
635	but the question i want to throw up is , why not ?
1607	i perceive the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
2753	ceos is a little bit about average . but this is where it becomes interesting .
6107	the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
2779	because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
2714	the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little this is being supported .
4338	so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt room .
2883	this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
1307	i want to give you a particular aspect of curiosity .
4376	you go around the block , and you take it as an openness .
2727	they &apos;re investing a lot of their time in assembly constantly growing structures .
4612	i don &apos;t know how frightening people will be .
6146	this deputy ran over to the older black .
2550	you usually just get it wrong and some people come , some people don &apos;t .
6073	wr want to help people who have been convicted of innocence .
1480	when they walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
2781	and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
4329	it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
157	this is a whole book , an example of non-image data .
6028	he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death penalty in germany .
4455	i became a miracle part , not to die that day .
4068	i mean , what is someone doing with so many outfits ?
2155	let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
4284	this is the average size of a size of an iceberg .
4647	i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
1610	and then the same thing happens in a good , reasonable conversation .
229	i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what gives us modern progress .
623	i have to tell you , i think this was a big mistake .
373	there &apos;s a magic crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
835	if we overdo it , we can shoot a little bit back .
6048	we all need to eventually believe things that we can &apos;t see .
225	the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
3280	that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
2	and of course , we all share the same adaptation needs .
3895	and as a general term , we can use the word &quot; intersexuality . &quot;
6122	and i thought it was so hard , so painful .
634	i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
4662	so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
2180	here he is highlighting a rare rail .
4878	they don &apos;t even come out of the museums in my mind .
4364	tempt will be part of the show , which is quite disconnected .
523	we &apos;re taking pictures of these mini-big buttons in detectors .
5175	autocolor , outside of the car -- i &apos;ve got 56 options .
198	we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
2830	so the question is , can we do that ? i think so .
384	economists call this a pareto enhancement .
1870	because he doesn &apos;t know what kind of haystack he &apos;s supposed to do first .
1353	this is one of the evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
3545	we degrade a person who has value for our society .
4674	so maybe you should put a little bit of this in front of the interview . &quot;
2915	what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
6160	56 percent of all rape rape cases don &apos;t come from court .
6167	well , in fact , the number of crimes in crime didn &apos;t change very much .
5997	the death penalty in america is defined by error .
532	it means that we have a cultural impact besides the scientific reach .
5006	this airport alone has 100 square kilometers .
3428	we use games to escape the suffering of the real world .
332	this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
6084	because ultimately , our humanity depends on all of our humanity .
1141	so i started looking at when is , of course , or intuitive .
4495	this is an excerpt from this angriffs code .
998	and these are just the biohackers , the individual people .
4343	we &apos;ve cleaned his bed so he can see out .
2146	i first eaten it in a restaurant in southern spain .
5291	they were afraid of pirates , rape and death .
2198	the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely autonomous .
911	this actually only took two thousand really eight forms , these networks .
4584	but besides that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
4012	but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
443	so , this looks like a basketball bilyoff .
6658	somebody had collapsed and hacked the system quite thorny .
1851	but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
1247	and sixteen milliseconds , again , a very exciting phenomenon .
359	i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
1750	this time , an anecdote talks about , maybe you know .
3657	our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for these bacteria .
1056	it goes much further back , into pre-industrial times cultures .
4980	so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to cope with all these extensions .
4714	this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
1674	no longer need to whistle or sing a song .
2938	we hate a strong government . we have no trust in the system .
4227	imagine that every single person is being run by people .
666	but instead of just getting into panic , he stopped .
4541	of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
4629	if you look at the people that you have to do with ...
1448	that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
1061	and they did this with what we call lead-land maps .
4518	and guess what we found in the attack code ?
6309	how about the contributions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
6182	6 : social failure . speaker 7 : 65 dead .
3106	okay , let me squeeze some blood for you .
6248	he invited the king of siam to dinner .
1136	and that &apos;s also what i &apos;ve had in the last half-year .
6002	but somehow , we get to get out of this problem .
4738	i like things that are strange . i like strange things .
5590	turned the trash ton on the page . went home .
6068	it was always so inspiring , so fluid .
811	new investments to create well-paid jobs .
4074	and i want to show you my outfits this week .
4928	here &apos;s something bigger . we &apos;re looking right at the center .
4844	this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points of imagery , i think .
2574	because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
6701	and within a few years , lego went went in every household .
2362	so i decided , when i was 15 , to be a diver .
3487	and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with me like that .
5848	fireflies in a glass i always found quite exciting .
6140	from my point of view , i saw the janitor go up and down .
2595	in many , they &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
1638	the x interpretation of a piece is comparable to that .
6614	a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
6343	that means the player will probably beat three out of 10 beats .
5895	i didn &apos;t actually learn that in my work as a lawyer .
6306	how about a sentence of new , never heard before .
48	on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
6698	basically , the concrete block had become the building block of our time .
3102	this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
4114	this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
5437	for example , the fish had been taken on a screening trip .
5346	opportunities that were not allowed were profoundly encouraged .
5566	i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
3635	ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
452	in fact , nasa has shown that there are many of them out there .
3752	this is indeed the true confusion of human and machine .
947	there was , in my opinion , a very good code .
4797	finally , in the progression , we should welcome the fear .
4741	why is it important to start ? what is the red represents ?
3414	my inspiration comes from an event that comes back 2,500 years .
4332	so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of constraints .
517	i gave a introduction to the lhc at the last ted conference .
3979	they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
4543	and if they &apos;re at risk , then really bad things can happen .
1682	that &apos;s where i ask , how competent was this diagnosis ?
6026	i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about the death penalty .
3081	this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
123	the modern industrial world as we know it is almost 300 years old .
3628	a couple . probably as many as there are creative people here .
2577	it &apos;s renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
2815	smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on the planet .
4427	and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
1578	the notified notes have the function of the letters of a writing .
6391	and i made my first mistake ; i sent it home .
6716	and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
4306	and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
973	so , i think it &apos;s a very yellow hack .
2774	they produced the highest constructions in the lowest time .
3174	well , the life itself lives continuously .
1910	there was the nuclear research facility called leopolshafen .
5396	photographs like this : a construction site along a much rideshow road .
3212	well , the two kinds of self , they come up with two terms of happiness .
3115	there &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
410	and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
2994	it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
4760	an eight , interrogated brand . how is your brand ?
2215	he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensively , not intense .
971	i think that kind of six-dollar , or something like that .
2184	i asked him how he &apos;d become such a fish expert .
805	finally , a solution that is large enough to solve our problems .
2552	now , i wondered , how can i actually get this over ?
4653	it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landway .
2343	i grew up with a polite portion of science fiction .
4070	i brought seven underpants , and that &apos;s all .
1596	the component becomes more and more to the friend that you live with .
2513	on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
4921	so , a few years ago , i got to do just that .
6012	in many areas , people were afraid of lynchmobs .
5773	so there are programs that can be sorted by the latest numbers .
6106	how can a judge turn a judge into something he &apos;s not ?
2112	so , finally , here was a company trying to do it right .
363	it &apos;s just as clear that the answer to the question is , you .
141	it &apos;s an independent area . you &apos;re all controlling mineral resources .
1042	and what &apos;s interesting about this is , once i get a little trip .
4161	well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
392	they increase paralysis , and they bring happiness down .
3869	the secret is that the game is key to these skills .
1528	and i &apos;m not sure they really remain deviated .
6455	i looked in the raw , and it was a little bit of a pink .
3011	right now , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
5540	and it &apos;s spread , inherently , organically , of course .
3636	if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
3933	so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism in our culture .
1763	one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
4003	we find other attributes to what their rights are .
1712	there was no piano at the moment as an instrument .
3803	he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
6243	it &apos;s about creating abundance out of scarce goods .
4790	well , finally , the film has acquired a very large momentum .
6095	i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
176	this is actually live on the internet now . you can check it .
3324	and that &apos;s what i wanted to do as a ph.d. student .
140	it &apos;s our new home country and it &apos;s called nunavut .
5828	this piece of 50 years of old technology became the most magical thing for me .
6365	and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
546	by the end of march , the lhc will be again functional .
6382	and when i listened to her , she made cookie sounds .
4129	so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
1320	in fact , if we don &apos;t pick up phosphorus and we abandon it .
4634	and just so all of these companies disappeared , one after the other .
4725	if you could do it for those , you could definitely help me .
4043	and that &apos;s why , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
1649	you learn to find the sounds at the notes on the instrument .
4358	remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
3934	and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
1248	this is the time of the most perceptions that we have .
2514	and somehow we have to make changes that go down to zero .
4388	i &apos;m sad that we never met each other as adults .
847	this is our youngest beta-tester down there on the lower right .
5049	my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
2158	this is a fish elevation in the southwest corner of spain .
4856	i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
3054	now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
4735	what is the context of the thoughts and feelings about them ?
284	should i answer that email ? should i write that letter ? &quot;
5454	this is my wlan-waage . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
969	so this is just one use of many that you can do with it .
5873	a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey now . &quot;
3785	but nothing was invented that would let me go again , so far .
1067	that means you navigated over sound and through rhythm .
4785	this is actually just a time dream of two and a half weeks .
6170	that &apos;s why the dramatic high numbers are in the prisoners .
5425	so the first rule is that combined photographs should have the same perspective .
1083	then the interlocking influences of pre-industrial cultures .
6478	some of my claims happened over the last five years .
6415	&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tone .
42	54 percent of the deaths went through drilling .
945	and then we started to do a code-off-of-the-art compound .
16	and the key indicator for that is the extinction of languages .
2764	so i offered a 10,000-dollar prize for the winner .
2846	and i soon wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
3938	and i had to explain to the journalists that there was no test .
4597	these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
902	most people know this from the software area .
2804	so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
6082	and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be more horse .
6089	when someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
6346	do you know how to call a 300ter in major league baseball ?
3901	and this is called androgenreceptor defect .
1399	even if you were to shoot yourself now , you would have emissions .
3353	we &apos;re developing into collective thinking , heartfelt creatures .
4560	so all these green areas , these are the most targeted environments .
6374	and i was good , i finished cum laude .
1580	that would be just the letters that you learned to paint .
6271	we live on a planet that is 70 percent covered with water .
239	they rented their telephone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
1991	it comes naturally from asia , in japan &apos;s trap .
1913	because a good engineer either made a great car or a nuclear power plant .
3534	and i tend to see magic as my shadow .
214	but what if the image connects you to all your pictures ?
1647	a lot of the music class is that you &apos;re just learning to read the grades .
2023	and then you can see what the enormous speeds are there .
1832	that &apos;s how to lie that you can just apply that logic wrong .
4976	now , just trade out the building of apartments against the cities .
6413	&quot; do you remember the patients you sent home ? &quot;
3688	i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
221	the official belief from all the western industrialized societies .
3823	bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
5154	because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
1708	so that was the very first beginning of a single musical expression .
6515	what you need is an environment that allows you to do that .
1586	you collect information about the piece in the secondary literature .
738	you &apos;re fine . the question is , how is it going to happen to us ?
1487	but if i ask you , how do you do that with your wife ?
4494	it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
6430	you say you never forget the names of those who die .
5013	so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
5532	but it does something that no other governance technology does .
2874	well , studies were conducted to see if this was true .
1398	you can only have nuclear missions if you &apos;re not there .
4100	we should be able to eradicate everything we want .
6183	eight : tsunami warning . nine : cyberattacks .
4340	now , there &apos;s all this rummel in front of the great unveiling .
1420	so we don &apos;t have to control people ; we don &apos;t have to be bad .
2548	the people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
3876	even though it &apos;s hardly appropriate , maybe it &apos;s the most necessary game .
1774	the human being shall descend from the monkey or have a common ancestor .
1655	loud and easy signs , f and b , et cetera .
526	on september 10 , last year , the machine was running for the first time .
1592	how were its circumstances of life , like society and politics ?
4706	i like lots of black colors , lots of gray sounds and stuff .
3076	i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
5156	one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; swing . &quot;
6494	and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely uncommon .
6232	i love this : &quot; watson forces human enemies . &quot;
2067	i played the first sentence by beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
5917	i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
4302	and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
2760	specialized skills and processing skills and their combination leads to success .
5203	but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded every minute .
3992	for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
6732	we &apos;ve distributed littlebas to children , and you can see them play with it .
3729	this is all reality today , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
564	people said , &quot; what are you afraid not to succeed ? &quot;
6120	i got in the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
4898	but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually do the experiments .
6080	she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
5968	in my opinion , mass incarcerations have fundamentally changed the world .
3383	so the interaction allows the growing of the ties , trust and with each other .
5887	in the short time here , i realized that ted has an identity .
4237	we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
1364	here it says , the more you kill , the better .
2895	and this is something we need to learn , very quickly .
6528	i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding , but i can live with that .
5357	three months later , i was moved around , and the adventure went on .
4188	and the question was , how could you connect technology , new technology ?
1077	so unfortunately , we have virtual god &apos;s a piece of lost .
3164	and she was much worse for a than b in the memory .
2920	why ? because we don &apos;t have children &apos;s paralysis . and you know what ?
714	be there for your contribution , whatever he wants to be .
5024	all the parties , all the fractions of society , supported this .
5837	it &apos;s bringing images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
6223	this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
810	the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
5302	the scaffolding out of the warehouse came from the rest of the world .
3397	they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
6319	and this game was played by university professors and so on .
6102	sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking in a very important way .
6176	bryan , they really made a string to vibrate here .
3020	a deception becomes something real because somebody perceives it that way .
5539	we now know about nine cities that are planning to use these app .
1183	and watch , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
5130	okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s offering .
1016	i wrote down four words , and i &apos;d like to just explain them for a second .
5267	and today we all feel also as owners of our pop culture .
2313	but even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things .
2999	and all i can say about this is , why do we fight this ?
2470	and we , for a period of four and a half years , became a real family .
344	why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
5551	and not even like a technology company , but rather like the internet itself .
1049	the crucial tools of information training have been stories ever since .
767	and the proposal was to build many more coal factories .
3286	i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
5632	and these apps allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
4023	so how do we tackle the question of the character &apos;s properties ?
6622	the reason : the government could track back where a text came from .
1993	you can see it , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
1648	you &apos;re basically learning to read before you just speak a word .
1736	and as i say the word justice , that uncomfortable feeling is gone .
4490	they knew all the bits and the bytes they needed to attack .
2240	it &apos;s the last defense before something comes into the body .
5526	you agree with him to sniff up when it snows .
6434	if you do it repeatedly and never make the mistake again .
6274	these are new nanotechnologies on the way , nano-materials .
1698	now why do i ask from my audience that it also belongs to action ?
2937	well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
1556	there are a lot of people working there now , and they can all be engaged .
4545	and neither the machine leaders , nor the security system will notice .
6617	because it &apos;s a little bit of a wax that &apos;s sort of lost .
4239	it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
4233	it &apos;s simultaneously a real-time 3d scan and a movement recording .
4804	big data is being transformed into huge opportunities for organizations around the world .
5915	my grandmother sat at the end of the room and started .
5358	before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
1694	listen to it consciously and say whether it tastes you or not .
3888	under a hat , i &apos;m involved in the history of anatomy .
3943	in our considerations , we got into all kinds of inconvenient areas .
6630	and this is one of the three main sources of the online problems that we have today .
3152	and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of these two have suffered more ? &quot;
990	and that then drives open knowledge and citizen science under the headwords .
3144	we don &apos;t just tell stories when we get to tell stories .
1848	if i don &apos;t have a right , the channel is not a man .
4145	it was when italy won the football world cup .
5149	we can better deal with more categories than with more choices .
1642	to keep twenty practices directly with the composer .
6726	beyond the simple game , littingbird &apos;s is actually quite powerful .
667	he ended the whole thought process , and he did something completely new .
1404	directly , we can get back to this way of restoring nutrients in agriculture .
5061	how good do you think you &apos;re going to make the decisions ?
2271	let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
4899	how do we develop this intuition ? well , we like to play with things .
1829	this is now a three-sentence that describes us a logic .
1415	because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and to take the nutrients .
5514	and they developed great apps there , working with urban collaborators .
6709	but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
4096	but only when i turned 30 , i really understood what that means .
604	this search led me to the ancient greece land and the old rome .
4739	tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
992	and this is the core cause of the biohackers .
2660	a nuclear reactor that even offers a solution to the waste .
6590	and in the end , they just want to get the poorest remains .
1742	and then stones open , so he &apos;ll blow your eyes up .
3317	we think we &apos;re not as good in reality as we do in games .
568	the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , well , here we go .
1338	and the most important thing is to look at the ground , first of all .
4379	it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
1789	and he says , well , i &apos;m on the fire department .
2648	it &apos;s a big wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
6699	almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
1422	this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the plants are carrying themselves .
4156	half the time people make a short phone call , they go to the bathroom .
2499	so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
2693	bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
3717	if we look ahead , these kinds of changes will become increasingly possible .
2852	we type , we reach , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
1695	whether the music is too fancy or too cute .
6535	you might think he hunted fins , but that &apos;s not true .
6655	it &apos;s unprecedented what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
4938	so quantum mechanics says that unmoving objects feel the same way .
4988	he asked octavio to become his robust .
249	it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
2249	because when the water comes out , it goes down in the atlantic .
5433	but this picture is actually completely assembled , made up of photographs of different places .
6607	this shows the huge role a marine reserve can play .
5202	every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
2713	and this is a mindset that i think is appropriate .
617	when your work flew -- not entirely your error , right ?
2210	&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish from our birds .
483	to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
6241	today we can point out at dozens of companies that did just this .
3235	we know something about the happiness of happiness itself .
3718	the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
5237	now there are 10,000 parodies from &quot; friday &quot; at youtube .
4609	so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
6331	and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that &apos;s me .
1581	the point of letters you can only recognize when you get the language to do that .
2910	i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
4989	in the meantime , i was preparing for a tedglobal talk .
2127	i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
3060	but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
3399	it &apos;s people who believe that as a single person , they can change the world .
6298	by 2020 , we &apos;re going from two to five billion internet users .
553	writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s , of course , more than that .
5815	my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
4996	and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the head of our country . &quot;
5070	this business , it was almost like a delight savings .
1564	interpreters are the translator of the written notes in clinical music .
1847	and if i &apos;m right , the channel is a man .
2897	he liberated us from one of the worst spirits of humanity .
6460	&quot; do you remember the patient who &apos;s traveled with the patient ? &quot;
2893	and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
5402	photographs where you have to think for a brief moment to figure out the trick .
1163	now , not anymore at the local level , but on a global level .
2292	and who continues to see that this is particularly true in men .
5386	and also , tans &apos;s mother today is in the fourth or the fifth row .
5483	and more than 10,000 aeds have been reported in the netherlands .
1434	because the frared facility could best regain the phosphorus .
2507	the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
4929	and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
2208	i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you put your fish ? &quot;
3173	by the end , it &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , it dominated the end .
2833	i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wonder .
5462	you might know , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 followers on twitter .
4802	today , more than ever before , a little bit of an honesty brings us very far .
6123	finally , i got out of my car , and i went up the staircase for the court .
4287	and just like that , the iceberg gives you a different side of his personality .
6065	she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
2520	now this is the basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
4875	that &apos;s the donated , in the national gallery .
6621	they also had to register a sheet of unprecedented text from this typewriter .
6603	of course , a lot of people , scientists , are confirmed that it was really different .
2322	so now we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
706	this is one of the most painful corrections of a creative life .
5702	and in fact , every living thing uses exactly the same letter and same code .
4244	this has digitized everything , knowledge , and it makes it available through the internet .
1700	an artwork you never look at has no power to do .
2324	and so i want to show you what else might be a little bit of a surprise .
3166	in the view of the living self , clearly , b had a worse time .
2333	and from here , i can go into the site and call it back up again .
3499	and thank god i didn &apos;t use a synonymous dictionary at that time .
3416	before these fantastic game controllers , there were sheep &apos;s needed .
4299	so we decided to support tony -- tempt -- and to support his thing .
4353	it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s like a magic board .
2659	and it &apos;s sitting there , and it burns for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
2318	that &apos;s just to see if you take a step back and look at the whole thing .
102	all cultures have become involved in the dance with new opportunities for life .
5966	the united states today has the highest incarceration rate in the world .
3027	the knife you can analyze , my hand you can analyze .
2926	we love to lie . we love to lie .
5641	i &apos;m going to start by just showing you a single , boring slide .
2546	the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
4180	but that &apos;s a lot of unuseful transportation and complicated things .
2483	nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
6693	these are the questions that we have to deal with over the next 50 years .
3299	this is a portrait by photographer phil toledano .
4433	and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to my friends , to people .
869	you connect it to a particular tone , and then you tend to put it in .
1670	so the hammerheads in the piano are the sequel of my finger .
2119	this forage from 2,5 to 1 , &quot; he said .
3871	to successfully adapt to an unstable world , we have to play .
5403	so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than really a moment .
4307	did anybody see the movie &quot; butterling and diving bell &quot; ?
5380	now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
3765	there are 68 million people around the world who are estimated in the wheelchair .
4335	all paralyzed ones can actually now communicate or draw with their eyes on their own .
2626	when we go back from there , what should it look like in 2020 toys ?
1873	equally huge forces with counter-present signs dissolve each other .
2025	then we have to degrade our pattern run capacity on the web .
461	now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
4931	so i did this thing in the same way that you make a computer chip .
4372	and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get like a scientist .
5958	of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
505	but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
167	if you want to see the functions of these cars , you can see them there .
6273	and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
4095	i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for a day .
5618	this is not political active , this is bureaucratic .
3204	now , these are three weeks , and these are at least one and a half hours .
5854	fantasybooks have always had maps , but these maps were static .
1339	in the ground , over 70 percent of the carbon is stored .
1082	what &apos;s going to affect our thinking and our memory ?
174	over-interrogated at the top of nasa .
3860	so sex games are common , both bonobos and people .
2875	some studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
293	all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
3664	are we in some sort of evolutionary balance in a species ?
5574	and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the creator .
5994	but you can also think about it differently depending on how we see our identity .
1477	if you throw away the wrong stuff , you have a waste problem .
1673	you don &apos;t need to make music for yourself if it &apos;s going to be boring .
2147	a friend of journalists had been talking about this fish for a long time .
2126	so the next day , just before the conference , don .
367	clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
2855	these were careful people , educated people , decent people .
4521	and this gave us a lot of confidence for what we studied here .
4960	how would your consciousness deal with the fact that your body is delocated in space ?
3467	we &apos;ve developed the game superstruct at the institute for the future .
5909	she was doing something that always wanted to be nearby .
5033	so if you think about it effectively , it &apos;s where we are today .
3679	and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotel room door .
1608	all that influences me , and all that also influences my experience with the composition .
4190	it causes something like a water curtain with video points of water .
3002	it &apos;s not about shooting genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
2441	they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight system , as we do .
639	in fact , he can feel quite literally paranormal sometimes .
1403	we do agriculture in brazil , where we regain the nutrients .
5643	this is a slide that i randomly chose from my folder .
5637	and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve citizenship .
6087	that we are all more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done .
2452	but i didn &apos;t know much about leadership before i entered these expeditions .
1442	there &apos;s opec a pile of orphanages .
5573	he types &quot; thylacines &quot; into the official database .
2018	if you &apos;ve downloaded that somewhere , it &apos;ll take a second .
4403	imagine a big explosion as you rise up to 1,000 meters .
1796	this is a little bub , and he &apos;s not interested in fire holes .
2523	and it &apos;s going to be 9 billion . it &apos;s moving to nine billion .
5110	people are always worried when i say , &quot; limit . &quot;
1817	the soul is something so spiritual , says something called leibniz .
1384	you &apos;ve heard about this before , some of the overpopulation problems of trees ?
4904	i remember watching a child play on a floor wave .
6184	different speakers : drug war . weapons of mass destruction . tornado .
1864	this has to do with us going back to the fourth century .
3693	evolution does not necessarily mean preferring the longest life .
803	america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
2038	there will be a whole bunch of conditions and arguers .
3576	and he said , &quot; well , you could barely remember me .
1231	and this is this projection of vision , feedback , vision .
785	so the alliance for climate protection has started two campaigns .
765	oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
4491	they probably even knew the size of the machine service .
5923	she said , &quot; honey word ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
5683	and that is , i want to look at this at the earth &apos;s time scale .
5652	something even more clever , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here in a second .
1111	which , of course , is very close to storytelling , and it &apos;s a computer game .
3998	we have two creatures , both in the mid-1979 at the same day .
4978	you could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
6457	and when he went out the door , he showed up on his rail .
2512	every american is about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
1834	the first sentence is , claim , there &apos;s no soul .
2608	the uranium is used gradually , a little bit like a candle .
1811	i &apos;d like to show you what we found in my institute .
1857	because in fact , we have to prove whether or not there is the soul .
4517	these centrifuge in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels .
182	but the spatial order of the images is really important here .
409	is it possible for chemistry to create these really large molecules , which has never been done before ?
5647	in other words , every step here is equal to a potential in the power scale .
565	don &apos;t you worry that you kill the humiliation of a say ?
6439	and it wasn &apos;t because of my supreme , it was very gentle .
112	that meant he was killed instantly during the chinese invasion .
2329	so i can zoom in in my course in a certain time .
3140	or &quot; how was their trip to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
1373	you can only be climate-neutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
5032	there are already two cities built in china , and the third one is ready .
2933	that &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
2769	so isn &apos;t it interesting that high-competitions have a strong effect ?
2254	we &apos;re not realists ; we &apos;re more enjoyable . we &apos;re lovers .
3193	in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experience .
1155	then came the next generation that we actually live in today , primarily .
4800	there &apos;s a big lion each , so we welcome the risk .
3085	you can see it the same way , but you can also look away if you want .
4292	tempt was one of the leading graffiti artists in the &apos; 80s .
4936	you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
5515	but what they really do is show what is possible today with technology .
4857	in order to get really close , you can go all the way to the cracks .
6011	but for african-american americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
4679	now i can answer all of your questions and give you an excellent cart .
2232	he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
4399	and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life .
1719	so you &apos;ll hear what you just imagined in the mind .
2331	and i can sort of reclaim everything i &apos;ve been looking at today .
5964	in 1972 , 300,000 people were in prisoners and in prison .
5598	a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
2901	he &apos;s just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a couple of other people .
6260	it &apos;s not just scarcity , the problem is accessibility .
1730	i say , ulf , what &apos;s the big car you need ?
6575	they didn &apos;t get eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
868	there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
5862	and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
3325	why is it impossible in games to think that you couldn &apos;t just get it all done ?
5762	i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in the connections machine .
319	beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
2153	who can make a fish taste so well after it &apos;s been cooked ?
6376	and it worked for a while until i met a woman printer .
6461	it turns out he &apos;s a street infection .
753	but if you forgo , most of the drinking water will fall away .
184	i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
1069	why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top of a to b ?
585	an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life &apos;s work .
1186	a lot of people use the word , but they don &apos;t know what it means to detail .
1744	it &apos;s easy to cheat this , and it &apos;s very different in mind .
4014	now in practice , people are not being tested on their chromosome .
4066	if all the answers were yes , i feel like i won .
5185	go from the little selection options to the many , and then stay there .
4570	there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , thankfully .
4410	the pilot had already wasted the machine , and we were not that far away .
1672	the continuous record today with music is not progressive .
2118	and then he said , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world of our own .
1810	it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
2918	she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against child paralysis . no way .
3077	i take something which is obviously an illusion , and i make it look real .
6442	why didn &apos;t i ask the doctor ? why did i send her home ?
3682	she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
4309	i said , &quot; very archaic , how could that be ? &quot;
6047	but think in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
3846	bonobos -- like humans -- love playing your life for a long time .
2340	and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge out of it .
5231	if you want to know it , those other peaks are also days of friction .
1568	as an interpreter of a piece of music , i only have the written notes first .
5119	every single harvard is now automatically part of a life fund .
4561	we have to set the consequences , and we &apos;re going to start preparing better .
2335	right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
4138	well , today , our environment , for the first time , begins to respond to us .
6462	he had potentially life-threatening disease called epiglottitis .
411	one chromosome is , by the way , just one piece of informed chemical material .
1624	he asked me what was the introduction of this ballade for me .
995	and what &apos;s interesting is they &apos;ve also entered southeast asia .
97	i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
3089	now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at the messertrick .
5743	so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
4650	our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
848	it turns out he just wanted to stack the siftables .
3099	and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
2160	up until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentina .
6147	he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in the courthouse ? &quot;
2376	so movies were the way to assemble pictures and stories . the fit was together .
6674	they had sold this program for 280,000 dollars to the egyptian government .
3109	i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
652	it &apos;s not like my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the channel !
6356	it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the rising branch .
6481	how can i teach you my mistakes so that they &apos;re not going to be the same ?
6135	i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started discussing .
3973	democracy grew in , but at the same time , science also grew .
6049	we do . we &apos;re rational as we are , as much as we appreciate intelligence .
1599	i then say to my own words about what might be written between this framework .
3290	some of you might be thinking , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
2746	and with each try , the kids get immediate feedback , and what works and what doesn &apos;t .
518	and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
3681	in front of him , there &apos;s a beautiful , devastated showgirl .
979	and then i took a juggler and i put it on .
1405	we do that in china , for example , where we take the waste away from it .
5902	their parents were born in slaves in the 1840s in virginia .
2034	we have now 30 gigawatt photovoltaics in germany .
2562	i &apos;ve left out time , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
5217	because that &apos;s how you do it when you &apos;re called yosemite mountain bear .
6053	vaclav havel , the great cherry politician , once said .
5254	what kind of scripts could you have written in that prescription ?
3750	we call these robot exoskeletons at berkeley bionics .
6600	there &apos;s no fish left over time , and we think that &apos;s the standard value .
447	you see in the upper field that the chromosome just falls apart .
5206	three things : tastemaker , participation communities and the unexpected .
3609	the crucial thing about this study was that the teachers were not denied .
2022	and we can actually turn that big battery two milliseconds out of it .
6715	they &apos;re preferred to be light , sound , engine and sensor .
3837	but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known among the primates .
2277	this is the one that removes to two billion years of working .
1688	but please don &apos;t , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
6742	it &apos;s a hummer out of play-dough who &apos;s afraid in the dark .
1937	when you build more wind force , the system starts to fail .
4018	and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
1322	because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphorus problem .
2330	this is the state of the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve been holding down to this .
6672	in those acts , a folder named &quot; finfisher . &quot;
6216	the basis of many of these is technology , and these are expotentially growing .
999	in part , with these hackerspaces , they put these places together .
5471	and they can do that through such methods , but also through crowdsourcing .
6548	i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
6731	lights , sounds , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
5389	because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t take with your camera .
957	and unfortunately , that didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot .
197	this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was actually recorded correctly .
2294	and if we can do this for raw data , why not content itself ?
5163	this is a highly unuseful categorization scheme .
2241	it &apos;s evolved over the course of evolution to look up undroughts . &quot;
2164	well , they couldn &apos;t make the case that it didn &apos;t work , economically .
2600	there are some innovations in the nuclear field ; modular , liquid .
474	it turned blue over because of the genes that we had added .
1588	you study the works he used to compose before and after .
974	one project that i started recently was to build a gene-gun .
5188	when i start with the simple one , i learn how to choose .
1660	i wonder that you often eat something very fundamental .
1066	where the language was subordinated from signed rang .
4695	what about me ? what about the printing line ?
5016	and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders as well .
6198	it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is doing worse and worse .
1841	this logic comes out in this , yes , in this deceptive talk to the expression .
4133	now , all of our objects , our environment , are starting to talk back to us .
2327	so i can take a step back , and jump right to a specific section .
2898	no fear , no excruciating , child paralysis , puff , disappeared .
1383	there are still sailing billions of trees in the amazon .
2312	i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the most popular wikipedias .
5961	and she believed that these were the subjects that we needed to take care of .
4398	she saved my life , and my partner and i rescued her .
2161	they grew meat cattle on what were basically wetlands .
5900	it was also the origin of many disputes in our family .
3216	and they &apos;re all -- happiness for sight is quite a complicated process .
4093	if you think you &apos;re looking good at something , it &apos;s almost certain .
5586	but on &quot; citizens connect , &quot; it &apos;s all public , so everybody can see it .
1855	and now our minds are feeling immediately , you can do something .
5840	i &apos;ll just go to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
940	but always the approach is that it &apos;s just to stop and be accessible .
1818	it &apos;s something that isn &apos;t gained by stopp of material nature .
5944	i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just do it . just do it . &quot;
2453	because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
1360	traditionally , we think in the environmental debate , we &apos;re too many around the world .
571	and i &apos;m even more afraid of things that no one would ever know .
3231	well , you &apos;d know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
2501	co2 heats the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
1831	this is where you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
1982	we were only five people at the time to rebuild a society .
6425	and after two , three days , it became clear that it was never going to awaken again .
2166	it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds for this place .
292	we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to get what &apos;s bad about it .
1218	and then it goes back , and then it &apos;s actually just being seen .
2167	and so in 1982 , an exciting company , with green consciousness , bought the country .
454	this is not an electron microscope ; it &apos;s a regular microscope .
865	each has four different variations ; you can choose which one wants to use .
3389	and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right job .
6250	the king of siam , though , got aluminum brick .
6496	in this state , approximately 24,000 canadians die of complete errors .
4195	and we got the mission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
4905	he was a little kid , and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he fell all the time .
44	but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
654	but even in my species of mouth , sometimes i &apos;ve created this thing .
6020	and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions are in the historical context .
3056	i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
6051	they come from ideas that are driven by the persuasion of our hearts .
2670	in your mind , time frame and probability , really calling something like that to life ?
2755	it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see , &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
1949	that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
1738	you can also try that in words like revenge or gaining , or something like that .
3981	and with that , they really wondered the future civil rights movement .
5855	this map grows and lights and serves for orientation in the rest of the book .
1429	that means we don &apos;t have to control people ; we don &apos;t have to be less bad .
4355	so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
1161	and these two worlds are just banging each other , new and old thinking .
6179	speaker : bin laden &apos;s death brings an increased risk of risk .
4354	and somebody who has such an artistic potential deserves so much more .
775	this is in our entire country of the second largest waste of america .
3561	the odds are the change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
1633	every time it &apos;s exciting , because every time , i read something new .
3314	that &apos;s me making this &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; face .
4407	well , i had a unique place that day ; i sat down on 1d .
4182	and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day remains there .
591	i think it &apos;s better if we live down our great creative appointment .
5367	i looked through the shooting wall , and i saw it standing on the other side .
5946	he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now drink something . &quot;
6303	these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
2459	no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
2159	it &apos;s near the mouth of the river guadalquir .
5926	she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
4912	but it didn &apos;t take them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
5377	if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s running through the women .
4150	you see in the middle the colosseum , the tiver .
6083	we have to find ways to face these challenges : these problems , that suffering .
3922	okay , just a quick example of intersexuality varied .
1548	so , the baby is carbon positive for the whole life , from the very beginning .
674	not the work itself . it was often as dark as eh and ever .
1123	of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
3555	so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest human abilities .
1527	because they have now moved the board two times .
1304	and suddenly , on an interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
761	if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
219	i want to start with what i call official dogma .
3407	not like me -- i &apos;m developing games , i &apos;m a little bit overwhelmed .
1577	so the music , for me , works the same as the spoken language .
3903	as a consequence , the body develops more of the typical female course .
5171	let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
5089	we don &apos;t choose to decide , even when it comes to our own best interests .
40	but the waorani didn &apos;t just kill the outsider with the spear .
4895	it &apos;s not like you &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
1417	that means you can see on the internet how to get the nutrients back .
1928	and then i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to .
4460	and more than anything else , are they the best parents they can only be ?
759	four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
191	you know , i never believed i was going to end up working at microsoft .
5943	i had what , your sister had something . go , drink a beer . &quot;
3993	i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from anatomy .
6007	i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
5631	they use their hands to write applications that improves government &apos;s work .
3920	and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one was eating anything .
4651	but when it comes so far that it &apos;s supposed to be implemented , something changes .
800	america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
4462	the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is pretty straightforward .
6539	up until the &apos; 80s , he was caught in great style .
3559	we can give widrives a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times .
578	with your chemical blockage , john -- how do you do it ?
2019	the spinning reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
4242	imagine that everybody can give a little donation to a picture .
5371	we told her stories , and we made sure we were still with her .
6729	the idea behind littingbird &apos;s is that it &apos;s a growing library .
4501	so we needed theories about these goals that we could illuminate or disprove .
6714	littits live are electronic modules that have a specific function .
5713	that &apos;s also why , for example , the contingency grows to antibiotics .
5481	so what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
4524	and often we just ran into a vending box and had to regather us .
5710	and that made these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
3190	now , the memory itself makes more than remembering and telling stories .
3769	but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose numbers multiply .
2341	and if we know , maybe we can even pull the wisdom from that .
2803	it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet are not going back , they &apos;re going forward .
1151	that was then dissolved by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
274	should i marry later ? should i have children , or should i have a career ? &quot;
742	this is the canal lusaq river in southwest greenland .
6639	this is wladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia .
4135	and that radically changes the interaction that we human beings have outside our environment .
5522	and they realized that the city never puts out these hydrants .
3063	if you take the capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than pills of any shape .
2862	okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what the reasons are .
3683	&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
1931	on this island , this is the island of graciosa on the azores .
5042	a million people are leaving latin america every year and going to the united states .
794	so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
6637	they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a lot of money .
862	it &apos;s a story of the open end , and it can decide how it evolves .
1385	that means that all of our intelligence means that we want to be dumber as a tree .
4588	so despite that warning , i knew that anyone would buy the name rights .
4816	i think my personal vision is very easy to explain to this slide and to her access .
1770	and there &apos;s this story from the woman of the bishop of worchester .
93	but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
1787	she likes him especially because he &apos;s got a propensity for rightness .
3508	our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
86	there is no distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
6738	here we see , with filz , paper and water bottles , like geordie ...
4620	but is it a difficult thing to do about the film or a hard thing for me ?
2479	and the mining of your team is more important than any lorbeer in the world .
5755	and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take just a few decades .
3305	this is a player standing on the edge of a so-called epic victory .
1653	well , there &apos;s presto on the front , which is a quick piece .
448	12 to 24 hours later , everything came back together as it was .
5604	and most people understand that , but they think that one is the input of the other .
5524	so he did what any good developers would do , he wrote an app .
4723	and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg .
5077	we decided to do an experiment , and we chose a brand report for our experiment .
3622	or maybe you &apos;re one of those who have always been looking for more creativity .
6171	we &apos;ve let ourselves tear down from the rhetoric of the punishment .
6320	and there are now hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online .
4120	this is what you would call , in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
877	and now i plug the filter with the barrel , for a little more expression .
3213	there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one by ourselves .
1205	walking laws of the nearby , stated laws of the continuity and so on .
2149	he came to the table with a bright , almost glowing white paint .
4661	there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
4853	i went up close , and i slowly realized that these kids actually beat something .
436	so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
500	you &apos;ve seen maize recently to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
4045	he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is female . &quot;
1407	and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring back our nutrients .
5790	so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
2832	i think we can power this world that it doesn &apos;t destroy at the same time .
5626	this is a generation that grew up seeing your voice for granted .
3829	this is the world of the wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
5385	but if i could give this , and i could surely get you through it , i would do it .
6570	basically , the bottom of the ocean came to deck and then was thrown back .
1954	there are always three of these that go , two of them are always being waited .
5115	you know , the average superpower crop today , offers you 45,000 products .
5058	only for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
51	christianity , islam , buddhism , judaism or whatever .
5363	at 17 , she became the second woman of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
1180	because steve jobs once said you need to get to dig 22 to see how it works .
4271	as an iceberg melts , i breathe in his pre-temporary atmosphere .
2131	&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
766	the united states is one of the two largest pollutants , combined with china .
4106	so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to end this all again .
3951	our ancestors used to have never been struggling with the question of when someone was dead .
1885	in fact , first you have to prove whether there is such a thing as willingness .
5513	instead of sending them to the third world , we &apos;re going to send them to the city user .
3306	oh , you know . ok , prima . so we have some players here .
347	when they got to 100 , it evaporates that one of them should have been perfect .
3982	they didn &apos;t think that about it , but what they did for us was great .
2434	the set was actually a very specific copy of the blueprints of the ship .
1611	you bring in a new idea , and at the same time , that answer will be answered with a response .
5480	nobody knew where the next life-saving aed was at that moment .
2998	that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisse , but it would be nice .
2890	doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
2545	now , when i use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
5240	&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in final loop .
3049	but that &apos;s actually not what this is all about . and then i open my hand .
1118	you can then explain that much better , there &apos;s more stuff behind it .
5788	and finally , i get programs that can perfect kinds of numbers .
6103	i promised these kids who were convicted of very hard sentences .
1651	when the devoid happens , the student gets the next hard piece .
2725	they &apos;re talking about thinking about what it &apos;s going to look like , they &apos;re running around power .
6090	when someone takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to him , it &apos;s not just a thief .
2827	that number is going up , and it &apos;s going up very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
3425	and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
3454	we &apos;re imagining epic victories , and we &apos;re giving people the opportunity to reach them .
5934	i thought about it , and i said , &quot; yeah , oma . i promise . &quot;
628	and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
1544	there it is in suburbia , but in the landscape , yes ?
1999	we can also turn up two hundred kilowatts of photovoltaics on the net .
2309	now i want to take this idea a little further with something a little bit crazy .
5690	these little oil spills were the most primitive cell form in the sense .
3088	and now just a little bit through my skin and then on the other side , again .
5521	they were there in february , and there was a lot of work out there last february .
180	so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by seadragon .
944	and what are our values and what are our targets , our foundation ?
1671	the melody comes from the healthy and the rhythm from the dance .
3360	so you know his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
1473	we tell people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have an environmental awareness in the south .
1371	that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
1984	the brown is , in a way , the conventional system , the green one is our system .
4745	... that doesn &apos;t have to be frightened . what kind of rollercoaster are you in ?
5410	it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
3219	if you ask about the happiness of the memory itself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
3741	these are decisions that your grandchildren , or your grandchildren , need to deal with .
6159	and yet , 46 percent of all the deadly deals do not end with arrest .
5765	and it does it in part with methods that we don &apos;t even really understand .
1210	so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think we see from the front to the back .
3415	there are these ancient cubes , out of sheep . you know ?
3445	they played cube games for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
3364	so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are the gamers absolutely good ? &quot;
3269	in the sense of the other self , the memory itself , you get a different story .
1903	i was allowed to ask lilly if i could mention it .
306	you really want to make the decision right when it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
5125	now before we started this day , i had a conversation with gary .
2735	what you might ask is , how does that happen ? why ? what about them ?
751	in the anden , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
1906	and i might like to imagine my island project that i &apos;m trying to introduce you to .
5503	now , we can just skip that -- i &apos;m just going to jump the video instead .
989	and you have to do it and understand how to do it and understand it .
1669	our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
4793	i think when you stop people from that , you get them closer to failure .
893	so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like that .
165	we &apos;ve also done something on the corner of this particular input from the guardian .
1277	so , as a shape , i grew up much more frequently than what it looks like .
1921	i worked in the collective for 11 years , which was grassroots .
4845	and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points of education ? &quot;
2083	what nathaniel was doing , so he brought the music back into a community of friends .
3458	it &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome an oil scarcity .
3825	i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the prosperity of humanity .
455	it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
1124	and with a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
1866	the buridanese esel is an esel made out of pure nature .
2404	it &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good tag for marketing . &quot;
4420	i could see it in their eyes , there was terrible , there was life at the end .
3712	they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
996	this , i think , is where there are fewer people in there than actually exist .
342	i had better . all those choices allowed me to have better .
4740	what is the machete ? what puppetry stage are they at the moment ?
4421	i &apos;d like to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
6497	in the united states , the institute of medicine targeted 100,000 .
6443	and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
746	last month , researchers reported that the entire continent now has a negative ice sheet .
534	these are 13-thousand ampters when the machine comes to high-performance .
3963	it &apos;s because of what happened in 1776 with the founding fathers .
202	think of this as the sequel of the work by stephen lawlers at virtual earth .
3181	it &apos;s the finite resource that we use while we &apos;re in this world .
6696	concrete stones became very quickly the master-used construction unit in the world .
6259	16 terawatts of energy collide every 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
177	this is a project called photosynth , which really connects two different technologies .
5031	the other place that was very interested in building the city is singapore .
4774	we went to sao paulo , where foreign advertising has been banned .
6134	he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you do this crazy thing ? &quot;
111	the father of this young man was identified as the tag of the panic lama .
2745	constructors recognize this kind of coherence as a core of an iterative process .
6510	and you know the leaders about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
179	and rick szeliski was done by microsoft research : a very good collaboration .
2485	no important endeavor that required innovation was ever accepted without risk .
2231	he looked at me like i &apos;d just quoted a song by whitney houston .
6335	we &apos;re near the season ending , and we &apos;re moving to the world cup .
277	and in fact , you should do that . these are important questions to answer .
3695	evolution prioritizes the creatures that are best adapted to their environment .
983	so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically sustainable .
4610	and i &apos;d be pleased if ceg would help to do this .
4715	man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was executive .
1156	this is just the printed through print and print , with gutenberg and others .
2929	i know you &apos;ve done that because half of the americans are doing it every day .
2135	i said , &quot; how much percentage of your futters are chicken ? &quot;
1721	or what i &apos;m thinking of today is because what you might have thought .
4716	man 5 : marke scheduled alcohol addict , riberling .
1748	they can make them less easy , yes , checking , or even distorting .
5274	imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life &apos;s work .
1839	they say he &apos;s got no soul , he &apos;s dead , and he can &apos;t say anything .
3506	it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
4438	i don &apos;t try to be right anymore ; i choose to be happy .
778	the frosty of the carbon man is a happy , happy guy .
3840	it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction is also threatening the survival of the bonobos .
492	we are , first of all , pushing into the limits of biological reality and the limits of our imagination .
4290	but the coolest thing i ever worked on was this guy .
1777	why do we have to prevent people from getting knowledge from something if it &apos;s true ?
3148	these are real patients who undergo a painful procedure .
928	so , o.k , to hack biology now , you need some material .
2456	we &apos;re going to play the cost of manufacturing , from ruhm not a trace .
5967	seven million people are discharged on currency or on conditional punishment .
1835	so the second sentence is , if sound is right , it has no soul .
4533	and in fact , this false data from stuxnet is already recorded before .
5228	just like the &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to have come out of nowhere .
4754	and i think some companies will only focus on a strength rather than either .
6406	the rest of the day , the night i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
6031	it would be mindless of us to build consciously and targeted people . &quot;
2314	immediately , we get a sense of the subjects that are most popular about wikipedia .
4136	in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
2894	they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
171	of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
2861	we talk ironically about it , with little show of leadership , &quot; progress . &quot;
4888	this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two containers .
1646	i said yes , you need to do that for about the same time as the language spoken .
5849	so you &apos;ve got to tip the ipad here and release the fireflies out .
6141	he kept seeing through the window , and he could hear the entire tohuwabohu .
5875	there &apos;s a variety of ways in connecting the world and technology together .
6730	we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a bribe .
4232	on the left-hand side , you see the views , the different captains .
4829	it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
2430	and i fly around with a little robotic experience stuff through the geese of the ship .
2237	she tasted cute and gluously as if you were to take a bite from the ocean .
1690	that &apos;s where i said , but i &apos;m sure you can tell if you like it or not .
5525	it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a hydrant .
2431	i &apos;m actually just praying it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
5046	or even building ducitous from these cities , or distributed hundreds of around the world ?
489	then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
2590	if you want to support for 100 percent of it , you need an incredible battery .
4529	so we don &apos;t have to worry about other goals being hit by stuxnet .
2783	it &apos;s a blog where you see the marshmallows building .
3648	in this period , maybe there were 20 or 25 different kinds of hominids &apos; specifications .
450	these organisms can be totally dry , they can actually live in the vacuum .
819	the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
3899	and that &apos;s why the testosterone in the fetal stadium is abandoned .
76	the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
2811	but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
3323	we never have those feelings when we play games , we just don &apos;t have them in games .
1965	people always ask me , what do you do research in adlershard ?
1584	the work of the interpreter starts similar to the work of a theater director .
2841	they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; sorry , they don &apos;t .
4764	are they something a little bit quiet , reservatives , more conservative ?
2902	it can save the life of 400- , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
4339	i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
2242	and then he said , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any embarrassment . &quot;
4071	underpants for exactly a week are all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
2285	so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical dying diagram of age .
4177	and with this information , we realized that there are a lot of inefficient in the system .
2351	that may have been very well adapted to that science fiction role .
2911	you keep going , you get the diseases back , horrible diseases , and this is happening right now .
5292	like most adults on the boat , my mother had a little toxic bottle with her .
5949	he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren that they are special . &quot;
269	the only choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
1981	have negotiated with investors , i &apos;ve chosen new ceos .
2393	and then we did that , and we created a competitive advantage for a while .
4596	now this brand , the qualcomm stadium , the stairs center ...
6292	but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
1276	the next generation of the graphical user interface has been working a lot more with behavior .
5753	the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took several hundred million years .
4118	and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
6694	it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete blocks .
1254	there are signature functions where i know exactly where to reach .
328	he &apos;s making a point about living in the now , and maybe doing things slowly .
4094	and if you think that you don &apos;t look good in anything , you probably have a right .
2979	it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
6722	you can put a switch in between , and so you &apos;ve created a little dimmer .
1692	so , they &apos;re not going to give up the food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
2793	a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and this is a time machine .
3546	so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all of human possibilities .
4821	we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
2026	pattern run is simple , the power plant runs to keep the frequency .
1363	in israel , you say , if you save a human life , you save the earth .
6016	they say , &quot; no , no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot;
1859	so , we pretend that it &apos;s actually impossible to live without being able to live a soul .
1794	although i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyroengineering things .
777	one of the advertisements of the coal industry at christmas was this .
3172	what a story looks like is interruptions , major moments and ends .
5663	it &apos;s not possible that everything will evolve forever and forever as fast as it is now .
4153	early afternoon , people here and there , the calls are doing and moving .
1099	there are technical concepts like augmented reality , which is the augmented reality .
337	do you want to wash buttons or boiling ? rock or acid ?
5842	and so -- here it says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; that &apos;s where i write my name .
2141	no , not because i &apos;m a self-righteous enjoyant and a good person .
2711	now , his new mashell is , &quot; why is research not going to talk anymore ? &quot;
2387	so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next movie , much further .
6387	i gave her aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
6165	this fact is often put into a relationship with the elevated incarceration numbers .
1455	a woman in germany eats about six comma three kilograms in her life .
3302	if you &apos;re not a player , you might have some of the nuances in this picture .
5612	if we want this institution to work for us , we have to do bureaucracy sexy .
2596	i think there are many that are already involved in the ted group .
1284	so he doesn &apos;t seem to like to think it , but he does it in a very simple way .
1693	so they don &apos;t have to give up to classical music either , because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
2551	but in this case , we have to give full gas and get a miracle in very short time .
2399	but secretly , i really wanted to go down to the real wreck of the titanic .
1825	so we should perceive them as something that is necessarily present to our lives .
573	but when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently , and i wonder , why ?
146	what we ultimately try at national geographic is we think politicians never achieve anything .
3462	nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
320	what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
3833	but unfortunately , we have overstated this aspect in the narrative of human evolution .
5905	when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and hugged me .
5906	it hit me so much that i could hardly breathe , and then let me go .
2050	and you have to stay pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going .
6456	and i gave him a prescription for penicillin , and i sent him on .
6378	at this point , i was dedicated to the cardiology layer in the cardiology service .
6185	recession . standstill . doomsday . egypt . syria .
6568	90 percent of our start with weakness , other animals that are connected to the ground .
1890	you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little bit more politically correct .
3758	so now let me introduce you to hulc -- or the human universal load carrier .
294	an effect , paradoxically , is that it &apos;s paralyzed instead of free .
6598	over time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and in the ocean , these are the big fish .
5309	a school uniform up to the crises , because it had to reach six years .
6117	and to my dismay , i &apos;d written him not just , but also sent him to the dish .
5928	then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
482	we &apos;ve gone from six-and-a-half to nine billion people to the next 40 years .
2605	and because you burn that 99 percent , the cost is much better .
6490	it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that attack a human being .
2850	but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on going .
2776	you might ask , why would anyone actually spend time creating a marshmallow challenge ?
3104	sorry . if you get bad , look away , don &apos;t look at you .
4558	so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for those attacks is not in the middle east .
6302	and instead of economic gridlock , i see one of the great economic protections in history .
3917	he had an extreme form of an innate by-cereal hyperbubble .
2543	so what we need to do on a global level is create a new system .
6018	and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
5871	so you &apos;re actually creating a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .
3811	one thing about most appreciated kindness : somebody had actually taken her a pair of shoes .
4986	in the summer of 2009 , honduras suffered from a major capsule crisis .
130	the family that was afraid of his life took him all the guns and all the tools .
4572	thank you for chasing a hot fear . thank you ralph .
158	this is bleak house from dickens . each column is a chapter .
17	when each of you were born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the earth .
2372	and my love to the ocean is holding with the same intensity as eh and ever .
4556	and when you do that , you end up with a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
1549	so , we don &apos;t need to be climate-neutral , we can be climate positive .
3647	we branch from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
3143	and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts instantly .
4251	and these particles are water as our cloud is a cloud of imagery .
1657	but even if you put those signs around , it &apos;s still something technical .
5822	we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
5121	you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to limit it .
1567	but it &apos;s very strange to say , for laughter , what we do to musicians with our music language .
1393	it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , in terms of oil use .
5475	we know very precisely where all the atm machines are around the maastricht .
2458	i made all these films , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
5233	now , tosh.0 gave it up , lots of blogs started writing about it .
204	their own photos are being filled with metadata that another person has entered .
1024	the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information input .
5150	here , for example , is a study we did in a magazine process .
4128	they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
4796	we need to encourage people not to be afraid of the possibilities they might be scared .
4425	because if the wine is so far and the person is there , i open it .
3295	i &apos;ve calculated that time would be around 21 billion hours a week .
6719	green is output , blue is electricity , pink is input , and orange is cable .
1274	so no longer zeroes and ones or kryptic codes , but a metaphor .
3055	a year or so , i read a study that really blew me .
1631	well , at the age of 17 , you have dreams , but you don &apos;t have any significant memories .
5124	and if their employees can &apos;t tell them apart , their customers can &apos;t either . &quot;
5628	you can make your opinion , on every channel at any time , and you do .
6265	and if we have an energy waste , we will also have water in the abundance .
5737	what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
5372	and at night , the monk came and said he had to close the sarg .
5754	then the next step , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
3381	the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
4498	and i want to tell you how we were able to get out of this code smart .
4865	and what if you want to see van gogh making this masterpiece ?
1329	and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
1132	yes , children are naturally curious , or should be curious , designers too .
1752	this woman finally complained that the portrait would not look like her at all .
5174	now these decisions are different from the number of choices that they offer every decision .
6467	in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve seen a blinddarling locomotion twice .
781	it &apos;s affordable and it &apos;s worthwhile , and workers are staying in the wage and bread .
5658	but when something like this happens , it changes the quality conditions .
5712	i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
779	it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it helps our economy grow .
5104	they make much worse decisions -- worse funding and worse medical decisions .
3599	it means creating something that is in one place to tickle the potential .
5957	we can get them to do things they thought they couldn &apos;t do .
1962	you can only , of course , if you &apos;re being manned in any way .
471	there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that are actually dwindling dna .
1776	and if it &apos;s true , then we have to stop people from getting knowledge of it .
5863	a story that interacts with new opportunities , like the environmental crisis .
4252	it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered in imagery .
508	it converts co2 into methane under the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
1681	or c , because you &apos;ve got them embarrassed that they &apos;re unqualified .
5597	i rather talk about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
5805	it &apos;s getting faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
37	in 1957 , five missionaries tried to absorb and made a major mistake .
1475	in every place where you throw away , from , yes , you create opportunities for life .
2308	it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
2406	sounds crazy . but that goes back to the fact that your imagination can create a reality .
799	finally , the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our national security challenge combines .
3507	it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct those values .
1149	but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very lifelike .
4212	and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with people .
2412	well , they were also high-tech and incarcerated planning .
4851	and so i started playing around , and i realized there was something going on there .
401	we tried different approaches to simplify it down to the minimal components .
6646	mr. jain himself is on the open foot , the lounge is unknown .
408	and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
6330	i think we have to do something about a modified piece of medical culture .
2785	they find crazy examples from all over the world how people are optimizing and refining the system .
3215	and then you &apos;d ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the living self ?
845	all you have to say is &quot; form words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
1635	it &apos;s always the same garden , but in many different daytime , in different light .
3092	so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
4206	now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
2607	instead of breaking your head over it , you just burn it . a great thing .
5298	after three months in a refugee camp , we ended up in melbourne .
5225	rebecca blacks friday is one of the most popular videos of the year .
5337	&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and be not what you are . &quot;
3194	and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
4531	there &apos;s the gray box down there , and on the top you see the centrifuge .
6389	and over a period of a year and a half to two hours , they started feeling better .
2675	and it would be best if it could create multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
5581	this is the work of very smart people at the office of the new urban mechanics in boston .
4344	we set up a projector against a wall of the parking lot in front of the hospital .
2397	so i shifted that , and i made this other film about the big ship that undergoes .
875	and now i &apos;m going to combine the filter with the subject , so i can actually drive the effect live .
5165	and you see this problem often when you look at the long lists of all these fonds .
2505	i asked the top scientists several times , &quot; do we really have to get down to zero ?
1987	we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
5014	and i &apos;ve come to the very core point that a new city offers new possibilities to people .
895	it &apos;s extremely important , now it &apos;s extremely important , and it &apos;s going to be much , much more important in the future .
2526	that includes everything , the food that we eat , the clothing , the television , the heat .
1929	and the title of the talk was , as you get to a hundred percent renewable .
301	and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and then , of course , never comes tomorrow .
2492	that leads to starvation . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unrest .
6546	the second story is to show a different concept , the alterable keyboard range , the shiftable .
2802	i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and i don &apos;t want that because i &apos;m an adventure .
28	and then you &apos;d suddenly see what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
5034	you already have a building site , and you &apos;re already mentioning this area for the second city .
4819	so when i went and went to these museums , i started learning a lot .
1684	or d , you may not have music , and that &apos;s why you don &apos;t want to have nix as well .
627	i think that this success pressure has rendered our artists over the last 500 years .
5779	it &apos;s using a recombination method , analog to breed . &quot;
3585	and he called this part of his course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
787	in coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
5498	and my little startup wants us to force us to conserve by ...
4183	and if we were to show that to people , then we can make a change in behavior .
5668	that &apos;s really what it means , then that means , we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
288	so i want to say , there were some options , but not all there was a question of choice .
5813	and i think we all here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
3374	here are the four things that i found first : urgency optimism .
5527	if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
5026	on february 17th , it was approved for the second time with 114 in a voice .
5775	but one of them might be happy with two numbers of numbers in the right order .
6746	you can go to the website , download all the design talks and make them yourself .
4122	what &apos;s interesting today is that real-time control systems are starting to emerge in our lives .
5752	the first steps in history that i told you were one billion years a piece .
5080	we &apos;ve put a little power cord right on the entrance of the business .
3855	so here we see a young female and a male in a consequence game .
5512	we select some field lows every year , and we let them work with city management .
3226	so over the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
3997	so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been mammed at the beginning of the talk .
258	and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
1889	and please don &apos;t use the german word for a prediction , which is prophet .
5039	one thing , as you already know , has been enlightened , there are many rarers .
3658	it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
4681	as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a challenge as a brand .
1281	but that also leads me to the point , when do things get more intuitive ?
3229	just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
5798	we know that an evolution process is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
3200	this is one of the descriptions that &apos;s given to the dominance of the memory itself .
1092	we &apos;re still very , very arrested by storytelling telling as an information tool .
1989	that means we first chose to find the world &apos;s largest battery .
798	look at it precisely , this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
3818	put it in a suppletop kitchen , clean up a park in the neighborhood .
1896	because he &apos;s led them to a fighter that he &apos;s not holding himself on .
5448	i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects fail .
6668	certificate authority hacks and fake certificate .
1319	we could only travel as amorphous trucks through the world &apos;s oceans .
5680	so i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we &apos;re in right now .
593	that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
378	so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
1911	they were all kfa at that time , and the jewish was called kfa .
1275	that made the whole thing a lot more user-friendly , but , of course , it &apos;s much better .
6239	think about the fact that a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
2549	there &apos;s usually no deadline that you need a miracle all the way to a certain date .
1978	we &apos;re cheaper than the same system , if the same price rises five percent a year .
3510	so , what do we really want to manifest -- a disabled person or a powerful human being ?
4282	please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the water line .
690	these fests were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
2995	it has no nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all this in it .
711	what i have to say to myself all the time is , when i get crazy about this , i &apos;m afraid .
6651	they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , about , an opinion , or through their audience .
2311	the summary contains a brief overview and a symbol for the area it comes from .
5265	as i said , one of the great stars at the moment -- justin bieber -- did his start at youtube .
1169	whether we accumulate knowledge globally and we accumulate faster and faster and better and better .
1785	she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she said about a student .
2560	now , there are all kinds of game solutions like this , but they &apos;re not doing a lot .
5893	as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , but you can do more .
4550	it has nothing to do specifically with centrifuge , with uranization .
3300	he wanted to capture the feelings in the game , so he built a camera in front of the players .
822	in short , a siftable is an interactive computer in the size of a cookie .
2782	and those of you who are interested can visit marshmallowchallenge.com .
6191	every second , our senses start much more information than our brains can ever process .
1683	have you ever given a second or a third opinion , how do you say beautiful today ?
2643	when countries meet in places like coppenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
6059	as a young lawyer , i have the great privilege of meeting rosa parks .
4382	she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the classroom .
4141	now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our labs .
1751	the spanish painter pablo picasso once portrayed a woman .
2228	i had imagined a journey of the penguins , so i looked at miguel .
351	and that leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good .
2677	now , given the big possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest one you know ?
6125	when he saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
4551	so for example , he would work just as well -- in a power plant or in a car factory .
6703	they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
1378	that means that all of our intelligence means that we want to be dumber as a tree , right ?
2211	well , last year , on this site , there were 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
3707	but there is a third way , a devastating , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
4568	i think the mossad is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
5912	sometimes , when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
4948	what does it mean to vibrate and not vibrate for an object at the same time ?
5644	it &apos;s not about the details of the slide here , but rather , the general shape .
1443	these are six and twenty countries that control 40 percent of the oil supply .
3159	and none of these stories are very rich or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
4300	i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
5083	and after that , we saw , in which case , people bought a glass of brand pots .
5177	what i do now is i change the order in which the decisions appear .
6507	and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re not always telling me their symptoms in the same way .
5930	she said , &quot; first of all , you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
5870	in another chapter , you have to photograph and tag a piece of tree mri .
4373	you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever chosen farmers .
4289	my life is really extraordinarily blessed by working on some amazing projects .
2281	and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
2222	oh , and by the way , these flamingos should not even be there .
6436	the kind of unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you in your heart disease .
6465	he got intravous antibotica , and he recovered a few days later .
3277	people are in the process of recognizing that they should think of happiness if they think about politics .
1005	and i would invite everybody to get involved in this and try something for themselves .
4688	technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the rollers .
931	and our approach was just to say , o.k , that you don &apos;t actually have to do that .
3165	now , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memory itself .
2426	we took little robots that we built that had a fiber optic cable .
3155	but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
3577	when i first saw her , i pulled her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
162	this is a more realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
3130	and then he added , really quite emotionally , that ruined the whole experience .
2348	it was always about trying to understand the world and expose the limits of the possible .
80	it &apos;s a photograph i took just last april in the northwest of the amazon .
5594	and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into crowdsourcing .
5214	this graph shows what it looked like when the video was first popular for the last summer .
365	with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for errors .
3602	they call this &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the united states , we call this &quot; tracking . &quot;
6246	this is the story of napoleon iiiiii in the middle of the 18th century .
20	it &apos;s a means where the soul of a certain culture can find access to the material world .
295	with so many options you can choose , people have a very hard time to decide at all .
1716	you know , beethoven , you know , he heard more than he &apos;d already become deaf .
2511	well , we &apos;re releasing a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
4417	and then he said three words -- the lowest words i &apos;ve ever heard .
2046	then they just use what &apos;s there on the sun and the wind , where they live .
3909	women , like men , have something in our bodies called adrenaline glands .
3168	that &apos;s going to cause the patient to be suffering , but only a little less than they did before .
5308	two little strips for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
5672	because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
50	if i asked you to count the great world religions , what would you say ?
1201	a second circle already begins to correlate or associate to certain similarity .
1416	they were invited to eat them , not to the nutrient theft .
4214	and this is what got us thinking about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
6585	it &apos;s changing over time . it &apos;s changing , because for people , their actions are completely natural .
6483	when did you hear the last time somebody who was talking about failures about failures ?
2344	in my school school time , i drove to school on the bus every day , one hour a walk .
929	you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and then that &apos;s a lab .
116	the nurse who did this brave was taken into an educational camp .
4997	so we met in december in the head of a hotel in miami .
3959	and i &apos;m excited about thinking about democracy .
757	this electricity in the whole world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
643	she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet to the earthquake .
5441	in order to achieve a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going from me , so it &apos;s going beyond planning .
2373	so when i went to a profession as an adult , it was the filmmaking .
4316	they say that all the things that are being shown up there follow a life cycle .
5570	that &apos;s where you usually come out , when you call in your city 311 .
3469	this supercomputer is called the global extinction system of sensitivity , of course .
5740	i have a very complicated , inadequate and confused idea in my head .
6075	we want to eliminate lifelong sentences without conditional requirement for children .
5677	i think the reason for that is that we realize that there &apos;s anything going on .
5653	now , why do we draw graphs in technology on semi-logarithmic curves ?
6547	because i experienced it when i studied a lagoon in west africa in 1971 .
246	and what it does is it makes people go into the business and ask that question .
4130	beyond the cities , all of this perceived and pushing into objects of everyday life .
2739	and that is that bwl students were trained to find the right plan , ok .
1743	on one of these lies , you can see that the liar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
4705	i think the genre , the style i have , is probably dark glamour .
2775	so there are deep lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
1341	that means we lose about five thousand times more in the ground than we &apos;re re-educated .
4465	the gray boxes you see here , these are real-time control systems .
5579	it has an app , a web and cell phone app , called citizens connect .
3362	we &apos;re getting as good at doing whatever it is , as the most important people in the world .
681	but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the open sky , and i tried .
6196	and the old adage , &quot; when it &apos;s floating , the demand goes , &quot; is very true .
3328	and i &apos;ve found some things that make the epic siege in online worlds so possible .
4795	i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks in the prescription .
3604	and the a students get tired up harder , get the better teachers , and so on .
4598	and so the movie is going to investigate this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
2518	so let &apos;s look at every factor , and let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero .
5045	so what is it for an idea to think about , in honduras , building a whole new city ?
6643	these are matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on and so forth .
6428	and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they came up with what happened .
256	the doctor says a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
6193	so the amygdala is our early warning system , our vehicle detector .
6582	we adapt our standard values to the new level , and we don &apos;t remind ourselves what was there .
1677	the question i ask you can &apos;t sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
5238	already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single week .
3059	and that , although none of them are a pharmaceutical -- they &apos;re just sugar pills .
3747	in the good , in the bad , and in the old days , as you may think , these decisions will be up to us .
3438	so recently , scientists have come to think that herodotus &apos;s crazy story is actually true .
5722	your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells , and so on .
2125	and that night , i lay in bed thinking , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
3072	this creates a very strong picture in the head , which is much stronger than a white pill .
5603	one of the most important things is that we need to think about this is that government is not the same as politics .
1791	yes , you feel it when you &apos;re hotter at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
3711	let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today , in some cultures , make decisions about their offspring .
356	they &apos;re never going to be very surprising because their expectations , my expectations , are high .
3661	but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria as important as they are to their lives .
1249	that is , this first impression occurs in a rapid speed of how we perceive things .
2553	is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that sparks the notion of people here ?
307	you don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong salad address .
6563	in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s , europe raised a lot of development projects .
3125	and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both thrown together in the notion of happiness .
272	and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less careful .
5812	i find it very tirelessly to say that we are the end product of evolution .
4702	1980s , revival hits the scaterpoint , except for the washing day .
494	we now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
6550	and i got a bad sunburn , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really come from there .
5827	when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver clock .
514	i think that this can be changed by creating recombined vaccines in advance .
4728	just tell me a little bit about how that &apos;s connected to your thoughts and feelings about you .
2532	well , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
6150	that as humans , we &apos;re not completely designed as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
825	and the siftables are an example of a new generation of tools for manipulating digital data .
1154	but then sukessive then moved this script as a primary medium , held in .
4969	in 2007 , i decided that we should conceptualize how we think about economic development .
686	okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
5055	and they found that the average ceo of the week is doing 139 tasks .
1685	now , what i would regret is because music is a nice , communicative thing .
3281	in the united states , you &apos;re struggling to measure the experience happiness of the population .
1790	and because i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pyroengineering things .
754	in california , a 40 percent reduction in the snow ceiling of the sierra .
3780	in the fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my beckens .
1718	that &apos;s why the composers depend on us interpreted that reinvent the pieces again .
2275	capital , chemistry and machines are in it , and it &apos;s never really produced something good for food .
3854	first , a ball game in bonobo-type -- and i don &apos;t think of football .
587	the question i &apos;d like to ask everybody here today is : is this idea completely right for you ?
5976	a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
2685	do we have to have emergency measures to try to maintain the temperature of the earth ?
745	at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet .
6244	because scarcity is contextual , and technology is a resource free force .
5684	i think the whole picture makes sense if you divide it into a number of billions of steps .
6092	and because that is , there is a basic human dignity to respect the law .
5472	and one of the things that we &apos;ve done is i want to share with you through a short video .
6395	and he knew her , he would have been able to contribute more information to her .
4454	more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life to be a good father .
3574	and i turn around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
3477	we work with universities all over sub-saharan africa , and we invite them to learn social redesign .
1424	and they &apos;re designed through the design that a farmer can just farm them .
3023	i myself learned him from the cub scout magic of the path finder in the 1970s .
2273	to do that , don &apos;t look at the agrarian industrial model for the future .
3772	so we thought we could start to write a whole new chapter in the area of mobility .
4539	we need digital security systems there , where a human machine controller cannot respond fast enough .
3257	is this something that you can share with us , because you &apos;ve got a couple of minutes now ?
3673	but at the time when multi-cellular organisms arose , things started changing .
6174	and i think our current prescription philosophy doesn &apos;t help anybody .
4709	man 2 : the brand i am is , i would say , the length of flying .
6572	within a year , you run an elevation and then you start with the commercial fisheries .
1706	and the child plays , after a memorial break , instead of having a red flower , a blue flower .
1078	virtuality has suddenly become alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
4148	now look at what happened that day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
1808	but we know when we say that , social relations are very , very sensitive .
6164	over the last three decades , the crime rate in america has declined immense .
2446	but the end of it was that i took space scientists to the deep sea .
5726	and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t do anything else than to process information within the organism .
6612	here , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulations .
2272	or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
2138	i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chickens to fish ? &quot;
2925	this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not .
6181	four : malignant cartels . five : dangerous cruise ships .
2260	no , not because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than just .
5467	there will be this little blood pressure measuring device that you attach to an iphone or something .
2787	and the basic lesson , i think , is that construction is actually a commitment sport .
5800	it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
2692	climaskeptics : do you have one or two sentences for those , maybe to convince you ?
3804	you have to go up , you have to stop on the fire , and you have to get a pair of shoes from this woman . &quot;
1601	now for me and for the composers back then and what they might now mean for him .
1948	by the way , about a hundred gigawatts of electric power are added to the same base of the world .
3312	well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
1044	what &apos;s interesting about this is , at this time , the human being was also media producer and medium itself .
2839	and listen , everybody &apos;s got a right to his opinion , even a right to his point of progress .
2082	and the reality of that expression enters us all , and moves , inspired and agreed .
6229	how many of you have seen the victory of ibm &apos;s supercomputer watson at risk ?
336	and the salesman said , &quot; do you want snake , lightweight or long ?
5246	what &apos;s important is , the creativity , the technology &apos;s internet culture and geeks .
3073	this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a projector .
5445	and then , if you do good footage , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
2043	and if you have a hundred percent renewable , that &apos;s like an aurogation system .
512	but at the same time , we &apos;re working on getting the same approaches to developing vaccines .
3515	and dr. p. always wore very colored flies and was just done for the work with children .
3944	we found , for example , the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
1097	it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearity , it &apos;s about storytelling .
3366	so many people now in the world , who are spending at least an hour a day playing online .
3857	this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; she grabs it in the eggs . &quot;
2618	well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to reach , and then we talk about the intermediate step .
4139	i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , the idea of perceiving and driving our environment .
1675	each of your own music is being made platform when you are constantly sucked from the outside with music .
3593	and this is what happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite these experiences .
3368	and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good in whatever .
3893	i worked with people with advertising grew -- people who were smaller than usual .
467	in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get the process a little further .
2212	it &apos;s now become the largest and one of the most important private avian reserves in all of europe .
2531	and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tasks under the street .
1283	and that &apos;s always a little intuitive for us human beings , if i have to think very little about it .
696	when this was happening , people knew what it was . they called it on his name .
2386	and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , this must be drawn into the movie art . &quot;
5903	she was born around 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped her world &apos;s painting very strongly .
3598	the real meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; comes from the word &quot; educe . &quot;
4913	this didn &apos;t like my intuition , and it might just be because i don &apos;t play it so often with things .
4826	i even get to one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
200	all these photographs are interconnected , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
6208	steve pinker showed us that we are living in a very peaceful time of human history right now .
3070	and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to reach the needle .
4223	imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or sizes , in different resolution .
4434	and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to get negative energy out of my life .
5607	this is because the government is like a farther ocean , and politics is the top 15 inches .
271	i teach wonderfully intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
1025	how about this now with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
831	if you &apos;re surrounded by the invader , you can see that , and you can get a little nervous .
5744	and what we &apos;ve actually done is , we , humanity , we &apos;ve started to abstract .
434	think about it : we have a four-letter code : a , c , g and t .
2778	and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions .
3373	so i started thinking about what it is to make these games out of us .
5531	it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the field lows wrote in the last year .
2226	they do that because they can follow the spelled white line on the highway a92 .
4226	when you turn on the light , it looks like this . so the way we saw it before .
2907	when paul speaks in a public sound , he can &apos;t say without armed guards .
4400	it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this has been mentioned so many times today .
5025	to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
3662	they &apos;re helping in the digestive of nutritional nutrients , and they &apos;re protecting them against certain diseases .
5351	at the end of every day , i cooked a huge top soup that we shared .
6074	we want to fight the biased and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
4443	as we fall down , i had this feeling of dying human beings is not terrifying .
3891	in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have bodies who ask social norms .
6629	and this was an example of how our own governments are using technology against us , citizens .
4973	but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs them to build .
5874	this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
2102	in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fished the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten the forests .
3080	this is really my meat . it &apos;s not damians &apos; specialized meat .
2828	and not only that , we have used our imagination to really devastating this world .
3282	this will be , i think , in the next one or two decades , part of the national statistic .
4708	if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes cabrio .
4246	that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
5884	i spend most of my time in people in investigation , prison , or death cells .
6615	and the colored sounds and cockroaches might remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
802	but now there &apos;s a brave , new solution to get us out of that misery situation .
1747	they need this lie to sustain a lifespan in order to sustain self-deception .
2575	so three very difficult problems that might be solved , and that &apos;s why you should work on .
3589	he understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone approaches it , are two different things .
1227	you &apos;ll never forget , because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmatiner is .
1483	so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that becomes a wetlands .
4762	do you have an up-attribute ? are you something that makes your blood into vibrations ?
5164	the categories have to tell the selection something that doesn &apos;t make the choice .
6592	we want to get things that have gone away , or things that are no longer as they were .
5738	for example , the most sophisticated version of this communication type is human language .
2667	i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
5758	and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosive curve .
4046	and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
6724	add that buzzer to an additional effect , and you made a noise machine .
6299	three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard about before will join global communication .
3816	don &apos;t wait to make a difference in another person &apos;s life until they get to their first million .
6650	the second largest group of attacks we can observe today are not motivated by money .
6333	but before i get to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
1355	because phosphorus is given excrement in the pigs over the solid ingredients .
109	and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of tibets if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom level .
4975	now this may sound absurd for you , as far as you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
2171	instead of pushing the water out , they used the channels to restore the water .
5541	if you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually work that way .
4964	you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
4102	friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailletes fit to everything .
2114	the day before the event , i called the head of public work for the company .
75	whether he &apos;s a lounge of a mind or a pile of heritage , is irrelevant .
9	and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can only meet you with hope .
739	and one reason is that this huge heat bulb warms up greenland from the north .
5544	it was about a method where parents can find out what the right public schools are for their children .
3340	you &apos;ve probably heard about &quot; level and &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
419	this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genoms phi x 174 .
5878	you have to make the sound of the wind , blow it away , read the rest of the book .
3980	and as part of that , they gave us a concept that was about anatomic commonalities .
5667	well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is going to happen in the way that this is going to happen .
4858	just to give you the overview , i zoom out so you can see what you get .
2859	we &apos;ve come to a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio to progress as we used to .
5299	and the next piece of the puzzle is about four women in three generations that assemble a new life .
3391	players love to become part of the awe area of missions of planetary measures .
5830	and it seemed to me that our tailorings and cameras were kept dreaming of it .
2410	and the preparation for this was huge . we had to build cameras and shaters and all kinds of things .
688	and i &apos;d like to say to protocoll that i &apos;ve been here today for my part of the jobs .
5162	the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
3486	i really hope that we play significant games together to survive another century on this planet .
6	but what &apos;s interesting is the unique pitch of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
3705	and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution are slowly maaling , but they &apos;re inadvertently .
1634	an example of this from a very different area . monet used to paint the seerox times .
53	but what makes voodoo so interesting is that living relationship between the living and the dead .
4692	how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
5285	the next piece of the puzzle shows how a boat in the early murder red is running along the lake .
3586	you can &apos;t just emphasize how critical this factor can be for the quality of life of a human being .
859	by shaking the siftables and putting them next to each other , he can let the characters interact .
3911	and the next ones are made androgens , which are viricular hormones .
3363	so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master-players .
3665	or are we , surely , to become something else -- something that might even be better adapted to the environment ?
1406	in china , a tutoring opera is now called honey pots , sort of , yes ?
264	something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice as to show this slide .
415	it actually took several years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
3794	i was the second volunteer at the center , so i had quite good opportunities to be able to put in .
1441	you know , there are two countries that are controlling almost 70 percent of the phosphorus resources worldwide .
6469	in both cases , i didn &apos;t send her home , and there probably wasn &apos;t a male in her treatment either .
6594	because obviously , an animal that was very common will only rarely before it dies .
3848	for us and it &apos;s a game that is fundamental to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
5627	they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we &apos;re all fighting about who &apos;s allowed to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
2579	one is the power density that these technologies create dramatically lower than the power plants .
4458	what would you do that you would shoot up because you think you &apos;re there forever ?
1971	we just wanted to know what about a normal , stinknormal electrochemical battery .
389	but the more i thought about it , the more i got to think that the fish knows something .
2991	we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotted stuff , like maniok .
1506	a tv machine , or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using it , they &apos;re not using it .
5109	you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today that less is more .
3875	for bonobos and people , similarly , life is not made of teeth and claws alone .
4632	i thought , &quot; you know , make the camera out &quot; would mean that we wanted to have a backup conversation .
2853	but i was worried about these articles , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found out .
3367	these are our master-players , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
5865	but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
3956	now you would think that the whole thing would break up from categories of someone like me really would make me happy .
4923	this is the first object you can see that was in the quantum mechanical superposition .
726	in a sense , the arctic ice caps is the beating heart of our global climate system .
315	here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
4202	no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building ; it &apos;s just that the architecture nearly disappeared .
4123	our cities have been exposed , in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
5432	you might think that this is just a landscape picture , and the bottom part has been manipulated .
1882	and what we can now almost read in the daytime newspaper is what you find in this third sentence .
2941	it &apos;s absolutely astonishing and sought to us that we can afford .
2799	i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re sort of drawn to nostalgia to wonder .
4191	when these pictures fall down , they can write on it , they can map patterns , images , text .
5889	and sometimes , when something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and a force that otherwise would not have .
2754	you put an executive administrator on the team , and they get significantly better .
2109	that is , 15 pounds of wildfish are necessary to get a pound of sugar tuna .
3713	it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decides .
5187	the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of order in which this information is presented .
4513	so , for example , the number of 164 sticks out of this code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .
2597	bill gross has several companies , among them , one called esolar , which has great solar pandemic technologies .
4907	and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
5449	and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
242	we now have almost an infinite range of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
4107	because the lesson i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
3736	why not have the fast muscle fibers that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
4603	so we might sell a shoe , and he becomes the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
5470	do methods that are easy to use , and start hugging patients on a team .
1058	i brought you an example from the north american tribe of the nootka-indian .
6367	in high school , a student once said that brian goldman was going to learn a blood test .
6195	so when we see the news , we prefer to look for the negative news .
630	maybe an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
3388	we know that as human beings , we work optimously when we do hard , meaningful work .
3078	now , we know from this study that you have to reach the needle when it &apos;s supposed to go .
5769	we say , &quot; computers , please generate a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of instructions .
4467	these gray boxes are not going on with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
900	and so , from the interest of this technology , i just kept on going .
4974	so we could make the world very easy with dozens , perhaps even hundreds of new cities .
6340	i &apos;m going to refer to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard of .
876	i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the speed in one way or another .
3771	and by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
1838	a third sentence that comes up immediately in people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
3556	and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re exposed to when we &apos;re really checked .
1203	this is what we call gestalt law , or even gestalt psychology , which also affects us in perception .
5446	so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that mics us is our imagination .
5382	yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privileged , of ease , of legitimacy .
4365	so basically , when you see something that &apos;s impossible , i &apos;ll make it possible .
5567	and like a lot of people , i thought that the government was mainly about voting people in an amt .
1105	all this requires the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
4761	if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would it be like ?
821	the question was so emotional that we decided to explore the answer , and we developed siftables .
1134	this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re dealing with , besides the actual existence as a gesture .
3670	now , when i was a neuling in college , i had my first biology class .
1499	we &apos;ve developed , for example , an ice cream package , which is at room temperature &apos; ne fluid .
4536	the idea here , obviously , is not just overlists the machine service in the control room .
1781	we need to stop people from experiencing knowledge from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
5987	in this country , we have life penalty punishment for children without conditional criminals .
6180	two : famine in somalia . three : pepper spray of the police .
5305	they somehow managed to find their time to adapt to english and qualifications .
5778	now , all the rest of the rest that the numbers have done the best way .
1263	that i do it in other forms and beautiful doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better maneuverable .
1524	and that &apos;s half the world &apos;s water problems , which are caused by the textile industry .
114	his mother was locked in being a punishment for -- to be wealthy for the crime .
1767	this is what we need to do , what we understand under politically correctness , over and over again .
4659	we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
6204	let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can anticipate the development .
394	this is almost limited to full security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
4530	here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really pulled me out of the socks .
2442	and so you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees centigrade , that they can survive there .
6429	the new day they had them go -- woman drucker , a woman , a mother and a grandmother .
1018	to these archaic models , we have a sort of natural relationship to virtuality .
1899	so , in the way that shifting the burden of evidence , you &apos;re experiencing the magnificence of the lie .
5287	for her life , she had asked her a job : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
3321	and in reality , when we fail , when we bump into obstacles , we often feel different .
1942	but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically the european .
5234	michael j. nelson of the mystery science theater was the first person to make a joke on twitter .
5867	as a child , i had collections of stickers , rocks , tiles and mussels .
735	already today , in some shallow lakes , in alaska methane , claims of itself from the water .
6498	both of them are strong conversations because we don &apos;t really look at the problem as we should .
3021	so in order to understand each other , i &apos;d like to show you a very basic , very simple magic trick .
6225	moreover , despite their logarithmic lost on the left , it &apos;s walking upward .
2106	so , probably , aquaculture , fishery , will be part of our future .
5064	now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
4371	so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably the biggest funeral children &apos;s author .
1095	this sounds very spacey , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know .
4676	either &quot; flfusion , &quot; or &quot; paradise winds , &quot; you &apos;ll have a choice .
5932	i adored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
3183	so we have the memory of ourselves and the life itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
121	and it &apos;s humiliating to think that our species might have been around for 600,000 years .
2825	unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned a lot .
3575	and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
2367	but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got to face two years later when we moved to california .
6482	if i got into a room -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
1582	so , for the learning process of music , you need the music language for at least as long as the spoken language .
405	we &apos;ve been able to get about a hundred genes from 500 or so , which are here .
6119	but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the courthouse and do this crazy case .
3831	that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
418	so we had to develop a new method where we could assemble these little pieces and correct the errors .
2708	i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
169	and this really captures up these ideas to create these limitations for the available place on the screen .
4456	i got another gift , which is to look into the future and come back and live differently .
423	the viral particles were then released by the cells , and they came back and killed e. coli .
2721	and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
5767	and what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re installing an evolutionary process in the machine , which is running out in the microsecond area .
4683	so doing things like this -- you know , people in ban -- it &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
2682	there &apos;s a liquid reactor type that looks kind of hard , but maybe they &apos;ll say that about us .
3689	evolution is all about the passing of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival after generation .
4088	if you surround yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it .
5676	so in other words , the future is shrunk by one year since i &apos;ve been in this world .
3292	but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is just the opposite .
5417	so we &apos;re overlifting our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t really make sense .
2000	here we see this again , again , again , again , again , the whole , aggregate again .
2837	people are shrinking in their faith , so tight you can &apos;t get them free .
3203	now , if i had ever opened up the folder with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
3516	i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- up to my physical therapy .
1172	because people often come , they can &apos;t make it user-friendly , so that anybody can deal with it .
3742	do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , that &apos;s more successful , that &apos;s more friendly ?
6168	most of the mass incarceration in this country was not really in the class of the crime .
4083	it &apos;s almost physiologically impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing red pants .
2578	and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
1687	well , you see , in all cases , no one has to be an outsider candidate .
6138	police officers came in and depicted state lawyers and office workers .
6162	this reference will suggest that the money will invest in more security and security .
2672	this is sort of the deadline that has given us the environmental models that we need to stop .
1433	unfortunately they &apos;re not in the open stream , but maybe they can help the novelists a little bit .
3334	you don &apos;t sit around and flip around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
6555	when i came back 27 years later , the fish had shrunk half its size .
2559	i &apos;m sure they &apos;re not going to bite . they &apos;re actually not going to leave the glass .
2695	do you say there are negative effects that have to do with clouds that change things ?
1771	she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
2012	that &apos;s why a lot of people come along and look at that there , just because you can see what problems you get .
5789	in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
4447	and that sadness really formed in one thought , which is that i only wish one thing .
3145	our memory tells us stories , which means that what we can keep from our experience is a story .
5393	so for me , photography really seemed to be about being in the right place at the right time .
2609	you see , it &apos;s a kind of column , often known as &quot; walking wave reactor . &quot;
5053	and then , recently , a study was done with ceos , where they monitored the ceos for a week .
5486	we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
750	40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
1204	the importance of the shape age , they usually have this in the first semester , the great shape laws .
374	i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed that dot a long time in terms of selecting our well-being .
4807	now , morgan , on the name of transparency , this is : what happened to the $ 7100 right now ?
2554	i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that .
3731	you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your descendants ?
6098	because in this context , we &apos;re just beginning to understand the really amazing things that are happening to us .
3669	this also represents the fun value of this talk , so i hope you enjoy it .
3035	there &apos;s nothing going on in my sleeve or coming out , there &apos;s no tricky , and you can study everything .
611	that &apos;s great . the romer didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
2854	and that &apos;s because these fanatics , which made me crazy at all were no fanatics .
4037	all right , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
1798	but there &apos;s no mess that we can look around , where you learn how to do fire .
1597	his cause of writing the play becomes more and more and more to my personal cause of playing it .
4633	it turns out it really meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to have anything to do with their movie . &quot;
5520	we had a team of fellows in boston last year in the suit of the code for america program .
2202	it was at the moment that a film director had demanded a shift in the shift .
1334	that &apos;s the way i would say , shake your child , put it only three times instead of five times .
503	and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first ones with the fuels of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
3227	and the main lesson that we &apos;ve learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
1096	but these concepts of cyber age , which brings us those opportunities to rediscover our capabilities again .
5695	so the tendency to survive longer , and they multiply in size .
424	now , i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said that they actually understood this model .
1814	the first example requires what many of you know and some of you estimate , very few of you just don &apos;t need at all .
5728	so the neurons are the information processing system that these cell communities have built .
4508	so , we were able to connect the little digital head with the rotor controlling .
4959	so , imagine you &apos;re in a couple of places at the same time , how would that feel ?
5766	one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using a lot of the other time , is evolution itself .
462	obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
1135	when professors get curious , they &apos;re often put in &quot; n research semester . &quot;
2928	echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you jump .
1746	no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with it , that they deceive themselves .
906	and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
1074	what happens is the machine age , and what happens is the book , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened .
1806	so these are just the words that we use in the language of politically correct speech over and over again .
1344	in openbach , for example , the garbage is 20 percent of the waste of garbage in between now wind .
252	instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a , or we could make b .
691	but again and again , very rare , something special happened , and one of the performers actually became secular .
92	we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
2870	but here &apos;s the thing : if you get the evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
4837	so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , harvest workers from pieter breegel in the met .
1739	i &apos;d like to talk to you about this mechanism today , or get something that &apos;s unconsciously familiar with you .
4263	my heart raced , i was dizzy , as i tried to grasp what was in front of me .
488	when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
1892	immediately , you &apos;ll see one for which there are , of course , those forecasts , you can &apos;t prove that .
3945	what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re only different from them from a few nucleotides ?
608	the greeks called these divine dienery spirits of creativity , galvanized gonna .
590	and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them be taken over the next century .
2530	here we see a very basic service . is there lights at home so you can read the homework ?
3463	but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you get said , &quot; we &apos;re out of oil . &quot;
4617	who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a horror vollion .
2819	in the rich world , there are diseases that millions of us have not yet threatened before one generation .
3365	because if we could figure that out , we would have virtually never been able to provide human potential before .
1028	we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them immediately , but this is what &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
3761	it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then i increase my strength and exhale .
391	if you break the goldfish glass , so that everything is possible , you lower the happiness .
838	this is a game with words , which is a kind of scrabble and boggle mixture .
5103	they make the decision -- they put it on , even when it comes to their own best interest .
1302	now i kind of interact with the object , can zoom back out , zoom in .
2913	and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids are going to die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
1209	sounds very banal for the first time , but it &apos;s quite exciting when you get involved in it .
6289	and to win , the device has to do better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified physicians .
2679	it would have been without the environmental demand , but it makes it so much more important .
170	we hope that it doesn &apos;t mean pop-ups and other nonsense anymore -- it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
3239	so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two species , at the end you &apos;re going to do very different things .
663	he &apos;s got no piece of paper ; he &apos;s got no pencil ; he &apos;s got no tape recorder .
133	the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the hurting storm .
4822	i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
2734	as peter told us , they &apos;re not just producing the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
2360	i certainly would never get to an alien world with a spaceship , and it seemed quite unlikely to me .
3434	they played a cube game , and the winners were allowed to break into an epic adventure .
6702	it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
2822	vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the success of the scientific method .
3964	the founding fathers , in my view , were the original anatomic activists , which is why .
279	there &apos;s a corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell you about where the wirelessing plan works .
3646	the human part of this book , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
1449	in holland , of course , it &apos;s easier to understand , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
6623	they found an article with the wrong thought , they could feel the creator of this thought .
2780	the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , or basic attitude , to build the right prototype .
3557	maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of widritedness , an understanding of the icon , a sense of our own power .
3614	if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new species of existence .
5936	well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yeah , oma . i promise . &quot;
2339	if we can do that , then this current data trap , maybe a new source of information becomes meaningful .
3015	i know we can do it , and as far as i &apos;m concerned about it , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
5199	today we want to talk about how videos become viral , and then finally , why that &apos;s important at all .
2504	and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
2317	this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not a single wikipedia item .
4998	i &apos;ve tried to make it clear how valuable cities are to how much more valuable they are than they cost .
6284	they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , as no one could ever have predicted .
470	so people who think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a moment have missed a lot of biology .
4843	this is one of the images we &apos;ve observed with what &apos;s called the gigapix technology .
2761	if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six that have stable structures .
3525	our language hints the societal change that has been triggered in many cases by a technological change .
4265	ice mountains are born as a cold b of a glacier , or by breaking out of ice sheets .
2411	and it occurred to me how much of these deep sea oysters , a space mission resembled .
4171	so in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
421	we made little pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
2265	that was the movement . it was the justification . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
6527	i regret , but i try best to learn from it to continue other things .
58	and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taken from your mind . how can you be harmed ?
5100	the more opportunities they were available , the more they put their entire money in pure market accounts .
2696	there are very , very few things you can even say , of which there &apos;s a chance in a million .
3272	but danny , in the entire american quest , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
2720	and , although it really seems simple , it &apos;s really hard , because it pushes people very quickly to collaborate .
1122	ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re about to see .
6364	no one ever makes a mistake , but no one &apos;s thinking about the details of how to do this .
813	there &apos;s an old african proverb : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
4527	so , by and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determined what the goal is .
3659	and you &apos;re going to offer them all the nutrients that they could only wish to do without any effort on their part .
3221	it &apos;s about how happy or joyful the person is when that person thinks about their life .
991	so , as citizens , you &apos;re just going to be able to interfere with these scientific technologies .
5392	and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press the outside .
3293	three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most pressing problems in the world .
5422	so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow , to get a realistic outcome .
3790	at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
2795	and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
4442	i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know from documentations .
4086	i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself and adapt at the same time .
4375	well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
1481	because just the ground , the mosses will die , and the wind and the water will wash the ground away .
4873	you can go and create your own museum online -- out of all these pictures , you can start your own collection .
2731	they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they really produce droughts .
896	there are things as controversial as all of these genetically engineered plants on the shells .
2031	and yes , the debate is always about the question , how far can you take a little bit of a future away there ?
4249	so the idea is that we actually put people in , in which they do things together , collectively .
5390	yet , my interest in photography started when i received my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
2816	they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever made .
4509	the rotor is this moving part inside the centrifuge , this black object you see .
5858	it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indian , but also very timely .
6305	so what can three billion people grow , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community bring us ?
2057	i met mr ayers in 2008 , two years ago , walt disney concert hall .
6743	for these non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics just became another material .
4476	and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , this real-time control system .
1387	every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really need to go back in circles .
3753	but not only that -- you merge and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
558	the result is , i don &apos;t care where i come from , i &apos;m treated as if i &apos;m going to have a passage .
5395	so i wanted to create something else , something that the process starts when the trigger is expressed .
5692	and every time it has divided , the chemicals in it have disparted into unequal quantities .
2768	if anybody had built an eight-inch high construction , he would have carried the prize home .
2747	so the power of working with prototypes is really critical -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
2003	you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to be able to communicate into the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
1618	sure , i &apos;ll have some color pots out of it , but i &apos;ll get some new ones out of it .
2193	&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
2263	now , i don &apos;t like that question because it has determined the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
3996	but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it from , and whether it makes sense .
4641	but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal error , and that was the following .
3013	we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want to go .
3408	so he says , this actually makes sense , because players can do more in online worlds than in real life .
3338	furthermore , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story of why we are and what we have to do .
6552	as you can see , the lagoon of palms and a few mangroves were surrounded .
491	the electronics industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
3403	his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
6235	so , imagine that this artificial intelligence provided by any mobile phone owner .
3330	but not just any mission , but any mission that fit perfectly at your current level in play , right ?
2363	the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the next ocean .
3532	the odds are not an obstacle that we need to curve to make better with our lives .
5670	so the question i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
3034	it actually sits so hard in its place that i can shake it without falling the knife down .
4842	those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click that away now .
1279	that all of a sudden , i think that the appearance is becoming unimportant for success , and the usability is becoming an application .
5669	we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the current world to a new kind of world .
4867	i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite parts of this picture , until i &apos;m really at the cracks .
6025	even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
5494	please help us do that , and try to improve health not just a little bit , but put it in the hand .
4580	some of you may have heard that i was doing an ad on ebay a couple of weeks ago .
743	if you want to know what the sea level is going through ice melts here , it &apos;s going into the sea .
4312	because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who has all that in it can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
154	and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
5327	and i was cured by a piece of puzzle to the next piece , and the edges were not combined .
1108	maybe you can just stand up for a second so that you can pause with the two on the project .
3573	and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
5981	here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the black population continuously lost their voting right .
1502	and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that they carry them from throwing away to biodiversity .
685	so if you want to have it better , you have to cross here and keep your percentage of the deal .
1041	and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
2490	but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more importantly than any other person on the planet .
4696	i have to talk to the man on the street who are like me , otto normal consumers .
507	it lives in the deep sea , about one-and-a-half miles deep , near boiling water temperatures .
1862	in the present , for example , we have a very modern example that keeps filling the daytime .
5123	and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the potential is different from each other .
89	they can only be done in conjunction with some other chemicals that the mao denatulate .
498	you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what the genetic code is going to look like .
4783	now , since the movie at the sundance film festival premiere , we can look at that .
2843	about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccinations for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
4910	and so they wrote all these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
5701	in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , from the exact same code and the same writing .
4671	and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
4260	through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
1728	so when i come along , with my little v v piesel and i just look at it , that feeling comes up .
1557	there &apos;s an extra promise , cradle-to-cradle , where everybody can join .
1257	back to my really natural topic on user interface , and the subject , of course , is usability .
728	the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a time-lapse shot that &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
837	here i am -- this is a fibonacci series , which i do with a simple equation program .
4293	then , one day , he came back from running and said , &quot; dad , my legs cribble . &quot;
5085	of the people who stayed there when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of brand melting .
18	now , a language is not just the full of the vocabulary or a series of grammar creatures .
6634	for example , this is mr. dimitry golubow from kiew in the ukraine .
4993	in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala octavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
451	i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move around , looking for aquatic conditions .
4163	the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the seven-team and the prime minister at the same time .
113	his uncle flew with her holiness into the diaspora , which brought people to nepal .
5543	we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year , which took three and a half months to do this .
3539	and we don &apos;t like our kids when we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
3243	so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are , you &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
6676	so , west governments provide totalitarian governments to help prevent their own citizens from happening .
6514	they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i made . &quot;
4768	are they saved , traditionally , nurturing , compassionate , compassionate like oprah ?
5986	the united states of america is the only country in the world that contains three-tenths of children to death in prison .
3760	his flexible design allows you to lift deeply , to crawl , and to do extremely agile movements .
472	the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve already added .
4724	they &apos;ve helped companies like nests , fat , hallmark to detect this brand personality .
3359	and some of you may have read the new book by malcolm gladwell , &quot; flooder . &quot;
1621	unfortunately , i was too young so he was already emerged when i finally started studying .
981	and then you can accelerate the particles much enough , and then they go into the onion .
5194	because i think the key to the best possible choice is that you &apos;re selective in the choice .
5341	and although i graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t find myself with a career in jura .
5421	but when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just look wrong .
4464	the most important posting there for the development of nuclear weapons is the uranian incentive facility in natance .
961	and then the visitors could go in the room , sit on this chair , sit down this helmet .
4173	then we have the little chips , the little brands , pasted on the garbage , and we started tracking it .
6231	i once went through the newspapers and looked for the best headlines i could find .
2448	we did documentary films , but actually , science , specifically said , space science .
2178	he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile for the kiss . &quot;
1439	the dutch government explained they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , reclaiming phosphorus .
2759	and that team that regulates and takes care of the work will significantly improve the performance of the team .
189	so these are all flickr-pictures , and they &apos;re all in spatial ways related to each other .
1226	once i &apos;ve seen that that this is a dalmaine in there , you know that .
890	i &apos;ve got to do that just a little bit , and that is biohacking is just looking at the modern molecular biology .
4186	and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
357	the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all come to -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
3523	this is just one example of many ways that adults in power positions can boost the imaginations of a child .
5335	she reminded me that i was now as old as they were when we hit the boat .
3762	we &apos;re so far , with our industrial partner , to imagine this device , this new exoskeleton in this year .
2527	these are very good things , and poverty reduction means making these services available almost everyone on the planet .
2908	he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
3291	maybe a little too much time , when you think about how many problems we have urgently to solve in the real world .
2432	it felt like i was physically present within the ship wreck of the titanic .
5772	let &apos;s say i want to make numbers , that would be a very simple example that i &apos;ve already used for that .
2564	let &apos;s first look at the burning of fossil fuels , burning of coal or natural gas .
525	here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so you can see the scale .
2096	even better , he was raised in aquaculture after the supposed to be the highest standard of sustainability .
2370	nature &apos;s imagination doesn &apos;t know boundaries , as opposed to our own , clear human imagination .
5353	most of our ideas were crazy , but there were a few brilliant ones , and we made the breakthrough .
5318	she opened up a computer business , then made a cosmetic training and opened another business .
1863	here you have to confront another philosophical issue , a thumb burning of philosophy , right now .
1128	i &apos;ve just been asked if this sack is a speaker bag and will be speaking to me rather than that .
2557	i decided that the free-out of fireflies would be my year contribution to the environment here .
6670	how about the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt , for example ?
2414	and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same way i &apos;d be in a science fiction movie .
3570	they didn &apos;t think of these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
1261	i can use that directly , or i need a handbook , or i need to have a corresponding debt for that .
4058	i get all my clothes out of two hands on flying markets and second-hand shops .
5293	if you had a prisoner , my sister and i , you would have drunk yourself and my grandmother .
2424	and then we started , we went to the bismarck , and we studied them with robotic tools .
2986	you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we &apos;re going to have right now . 70 percent .
3475	and the last game we bring out on march three , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
172	and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to be contributing to this area as well .
6321	and it showed today that human pattern recognition is better folding the proteins than the best supercomputer .
99	now , this doesn &apos;t get you a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count than triina .
5222	jimmy kimmel sent the tweet , which ended up making the video so popular .
5681	so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk first about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
3504	in particular , the last two words shake me under &quot; antony near me &quot; all &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
5818	if we wanted to travel now , we jumped into a car and swirl over the sky .
5941	i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . all right . just do you . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
4872	all of you , all of you , equally rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
2582	the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , but it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and it doesn &apos;t seem to keep the wind going .
3450	we have this banner in our office in palo alto , expressing how we should understand the future .
5703	we &apos;re so far that we can write , just for the sake purpose , ourselves in this code .
5851	another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single murmute .
4972	there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t even have a single city that they welcome .
1569	you think that the component is all written in the notes that he came up with .
1737	our organism has invented a great way to get these unpleasant feelings like neither of us just to disappear .
5559	they &apos;re terribly frustrated with it , but they &apos;re not complaining about it , they repair it .
5323	in one of them , i was the classic asian student , who was asking unquestionable demands of himself .
4228	it could have every single image point of an impulse that comes from people , from the movements of the human or something like that .
2301	now , when i look at this , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and the athletes .
4449	about a month after that , i went to see a moment in my daughter -- first grader , not a lot of artistic talent ...
6532	and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories earlier to use time .
5370	a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and sat around her sarg .
5253	who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or nyan cat ? &quot;
4401	it needs the same -- it would take love and pleasure . and it &apos;s to give us these things .
5634	and sure we could have released these hydrants all the time , and many people do .
56	so the voodoists like to say , &quot; you white go to church and talk about god .
3838	they live in the deep congolese forests , and they &apos;re just hard to watch .
4590	but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we look at the world of marketing , advertising .
478	now i &apos;ve made the argument that this is not the genesis -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
626	this is degrading and distorting whole egos , and it creates all these inaccessible expectations of success .
3967	the glorious of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the birth right .
6001	we would never let anyone fly on an airplane if for nine airplanes to take off , one falls off .
212	and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of the semantic information that many of these pictures have .
621	it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to think that creativity came from their own individual .
426	so we think that this is a situation in software that actually can build your own hardware in a biological system .
5776	now i say , &quot; computer , take the 10 percent of the sequences that came next to my prescription .
1961	that means , at the moment , you have to make sure that renewables can sort of take over the entire net .
5707	if i really had been a selfish , i would have written it on a virus and released it into the space .
1213	that is , they projy a assumption on the front , that they see what they recognize , unprecedented circle .
4424	as i was thinking about it later , i came up with a saying , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wine . &quot;
2632	the al gore book &quot; we have a choice &quot; and david mckays &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
2835	and we &apos;ve never been able to use it reasonably , just as we can do today .
2427	our intention was to dive in and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
656	even i had work or ideas that came through from a source that i really can &apos;t identify .
4198	there are no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and put it in .
6173	i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a criminal , not less .
380	what i &apos;m going to tell you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
23	they &apos;re not taught any more . that means , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually already dead .
670	if you really want to exist , come back to a cheaper moment , if i can take care of you .
4261	the first time i was in antarctica , almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first iceberg .
2190	and my head got weak about this cooked piece of delicious fish that i had in the evening .
4275	part of the ice in the iceberg i &apos;m photographing is very young -- a few thousand years old .
71	so , indigenous are neither sentimental , nor are they chosen by the nostalgia .
5105	they choose more for things that they make themselves less satisfied , even if they make it objective better .
769	here are the ones that have been stripped in the last few years , with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
2068	and as i played , it occurred to me that in nathic &apos;s eyes , a complete change was happening .
2039	the nice thing is , i &apos;ve been basically experiencing , in the last two years , that scientists are putting themselves on my side .
684	because you can see that i &apos;m investing everything i have , i don &apos;t have more than that .
2371	up to this day , i feel the greatest awe of what i see on my dives .
3400	and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real world .
725	but that doesn &apos;t really expresse the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
3908	it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually keep this person male , but they &apos;re not really .
1054	now we think our love of stories depends on the fact that as a child we &apos;ve sat on our parents &apos; lap .
5814	well , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;ll stop here before i get chosen .
1482	but if you &apos;re in italy , any footprint means that the water lasts longer in the meadow .
3393	the second largest wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 entries , is the world of warcraft wiki .
2070	nathaniel &apos;s manic zorn turned to understanding , in a quiet curiosity and courage .
4882	i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to talk to this digital medium of art and represent it properly online .
5172	here &apos;s a german car manufacturer that allows you to completely configure your car .
2726	then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and they sketch and they spaghetti .
2064	he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone was going to poison him in the sleep .
5511	the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little like the peacekeepers for geeks .
2555	the idea became really tangible for them , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
915	and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself yourself dot org , d.i.y.bio .
3136	what it really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two kinds of self .
3961	i know they were racial , i know they were sexist , but they were great .
3042	the reason why i hang my wrist on this is because it &apos;s the actual secret of the illusion .
1639	by now , i &apos;ve been older than chopin at age two and thirty when he wrote the play .
346	i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when they were just in one way .
536	they can afford that because if you cool them very far , they become what they call the superconductors .
5799	so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process that &apos;s very different from the classic engineering creature .
3991	well , well-remembered , i want to sustain certain distinctions , anatomically , in our culture .
3336	wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with you to finish your epic mission .
1773	and then she ran into her husband and said , this is probably not true what charles wrote .
2357	in math education , i was always caught by the teacher , how i hid behind the textbook , painted around .
2295	so what we have here are the title pictures of every single &quot; sports illustration &quot; that have ever been printed .
870	and then over-coded effects like tempo and volume that you apply to the whole sequence .
3562	i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
6657	last fall , it had to sign insolves , because diginotar had been hacked .
1232	now i know , and now i projy , in the front , that i see the dalmatiner .
6194	it carries and enters all the information in the search for any indication of the danger in our environment .
1766	but we should just get familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a nice somewhere else .
4486	it could be , for example , an american power plant or a chemical plant in germany .
817	i want to start asking you to think back at the time of your childhood when you &apos;re playing with building blocks .
4167	another quick example of sensing : this is not about people , but it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
5563	and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you to think about it because things change .
2223	they breed in a city 240 kilometers away , where the soil compound is better for nest maintenance .
5942	my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;ll do it now . we &apos;ll do it now ; you &apos;ll do everything else we do .
3275	dk : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
1869	and if you place the exact act act act act act in the middle between two large hairs of magnitude , it hungates .
3535	sometimes i realize he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly seen , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
6111	and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think that anymore , i started working on a post .
3958	to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought it was anxious to me .
5969	in socially poor and black parts of the population , there &apos;s despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
1772	that the man should escape from the monkey and , yes , there would be at least a common ancestor between humans and apes .
6249	napoleon &apos;s soldiers got silver brick , napoleon himself got gold cream .
5374	she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
4775	in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s been no running afar , no poster , no flyer , nothing .
3465	find out how they would survive , and most of our players have served in the game to keep sergeant habits .
1427	you could just throw in a liter alpha so easily , and then the plant would be ruined for years .
245	and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business yet , you can be sure you &apos;re going to be there soon .
6055	this mental orientation is the core of what i believe the ted community must be engaged in .
5223	because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel offers new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
5956	when we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t believe first .
2282	you know , this is right to me , because if this is the future of good food , it will be delicious .
4707	but i usually have an accessories , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and stuff like that .
4890	if we had a measure to measure the aptitute of each hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
330	and these other things may have a lot of attractive properties , and it will do what they &apos;re going to do to make less attractive .
2645	we need market rice , carbon taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade , something that creates a price signal .
3865	i think just how they play us sometimes , and we read boundaries of our inner and outer worlds .
1326	in the last 20 years alone , five thousand tons of uranium have been distributed in our fields in germany alone .
4283	you can see here , he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man &apos;s standing there .
1062	you may know that , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in this , the australian villagers .
6706	in the meantime , the next year at bell labs , the next revolution was announced , the next building block .
1558	so no longer saving , quoting , avoid , reducing , no school management , but intelligent waste .
2033	it &apos;s not , it &apos;s wax , it &apos;s child toy , we &apos;ve done everything , it &apos;s never calculated .
510	within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
296	i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this , a study of investments in volunteering retirement studies .
6253	although aluminum takes 8.3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it &apos;s not as pure metal .
2289	and that &apos;s because in the middle of this , the people are the most active , and they &apos;re most comfortable over here .
6154	you &apos;ve heard , in this audience , this community , an obvious desire and to help you and do something .
606	but in ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
1410	that &apos;s why all the western rich are always expanded , until they haven &apos;t made the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re imploted .
844	one interesting fact about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
3892	so for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are siamesian twins , two people in a body .
3474	they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they could read when they google &quot; superstruct . &quot;
5861	the poor apsaras were trapped in indras for thousands of years in an old , old , courageous book .
1457	this is not exactly accurate science , because we don &apos;t know how much we need to be kissed .
3453	we want to think about the best possible outcome , and then people are empowering to translate this notion into reality .
5414	we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-dimensional world .
1759	and then that unpleasant feeling disappears , because it might not look like you , and it will make you look more and more like that .
3954	but today we are in a situation where we take people &apos;s life-important organs and we want to plant them to other people .
6692	and do we trust , are we blind to any future government , a government we might have in 50 years ?
3327	so i started looking at games like world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment for collaborative problem solving .
2378	in &quot; abyss , &quot; i was able to connect my preferences to the underwater world and make the dive with the filmmaking .
5535	it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sins work , but people steal the batteries .
2183	it turns out miguel has spent most of his career in mikumi national park in africa .
4052	so that as people , when we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
4889	this is the one on the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
695	he was lit from the inside , and he was lit from the bottom , and everything was illuminated through a divine fire .
3995	so there are some anatomic separations that make sense to me , and that we think we should keep .
1116	and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data of the data that we create with the real world .
2163	they built this complicated series of channels , and they pushed water out of the country and out into the river .
2078	because the music allows him to reframe his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity into something real .
5313	there was a meeting to reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to get you out of the way . &quot;
2955	hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in one country , which is worse than any other disease .
286	everywhere we look , big things and small things , tangible things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
6586	every generation looks at the images that you take in the beginning of your conscious life , as standard , and it will deflect everything from it .
651	when i heard this , i thought -- this is creepy -- this is exactly how my process of creativity was going off .
5076	and he showed up on the bus loads of tourists that came every day and usually had their cameras on it .
2845	i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article , and i went on .
339	would you like to cut down , cookie , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on he said .
6251	aluminum , at that time , was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and plate .
1641	and it &apos;s important to me to look back into the notes , even though i mean to be able to memorize them .
3994	i don &apos;t want to say that five year-olds should have the right to give their sense of sex or marry .
1109	and i &apos;ve taken this project as an example of how , again , this archaic , cognitive model addresses .
1609	what &apos;s wonderful is , when i &apos;m standing on the stage with a duo partner , and we have the same wavelength .
1661	that is that , in order to make music on the instrument , your own musical do and feel should have been there before .
4573	i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years putting myself in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time dangerous .
4006	heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only maria now in a few states marry a woman .
3987	we find men in the march corners of the citizen movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
1943	if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island already have .
2182	and here he &apos;s looking at a pattern of bundles that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
3444	this was the first strategy game in real time of the world of crafi series . this was 16 years ago .
3468	the starting point is to compute a supercomputer computation that people have only 23 years left on the planet .
6372	i even knew the differential diagnosis to classify renal tubuläre azidose .
4512	the big digital head -- we got a glimpse by looking at very precisely data and data structures .
4098	if you believe that you &apos;re inside and outside , you &apos;re a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
2916	a commilitary of mine wrote me a couple of weeks ago , and she said i &apos;m a little bit too shit .
6474	and he did , and when he determined an enclosure in the lower sector , he called the operators .
6740	here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , which is a movable confectile cannon .
6473	i ordered fluide to rehydrating it , and also asked my colleagues to watch it .
5955	i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s virtuous . i say that because identity is what it means .
6503	we have a cognitive error so that we can take a perfect pathway for a breast pain patient .
4169	this is a map that shows you all the chips , where a mac computer is made , how they came together .
867	and you put it in , just by holding a ton-siftable to a sequencing machine .
2480	come to me , i get young filmmakers saying , &quot; give me an advice i can do that . &quot;
1471	that means everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing .
1537	this is the first ecological backpack , actually , which is made to go back into the circulation .
6656	diginotar is a complete certificate from the netherlands -- or that &apos;s it .
6500	in a hospital system where medical knowledge doubles every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
4220	you can have some sort of flexible screen or display , like this one -- an equal formation in two dimensions .
4504	basically , it depends on the boarding nuclear power plant and the copyright incentive plant in natanz .
2252	what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , one where food actually tastes well .
1938	this is what i always tell the politicians when they occupy in berlin adler &apos;s office .
6611	what about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
5629	so , when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care so much about using their voices .
125	when we ask these myriad world cultures about the importance of humanity , they answer 10,000 different voices .
4611	you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
4409	so i looked at her in a second , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
400	what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand , and at different levels .
5304	my mother worked on farms , then on a assembly line in a car factory , six days , double layers .
3265	60,000 dollars a year are unhappy people , and they become increasingly less happy as they get poorer .
1594	you think of it in that time by looking at contemporary images , for example , or reading literature .
1090	and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as law , and there are only exceptions , like the non-linearity .
1088	we don &apos;t see the thing anymore in images that doesn &apos;t make things into images , but we encode them our language .
1888	practice this , for example , if you meet a human being that you can say , there &apos;s no previous speaker .
2366	i made my diving in a pool of ymca in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
5326	and because of this aid , i was mentioned in my last year of law school as a young australian teacher of the year .
484	today , three people on this planet have existed for everyone in 1946 , and within 40 years , it will be four .
5178	half of the clients are going to go from the many ways , 56 autocolor to the small opportunities , four motors .
524	this is what i &apos;m working on . it &apos;s called the atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
3781	not long after that , a doctor came into my hospital room and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never be able to leave again . &quot;
1271	but i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s a very powerful increase for us to achieve certain things .
4047	feminism is about solving stereotypes about gender , which is why feminism is not female .
2402	but i convinced her by saying , &quot; we &apos;re moving to the wreck . we &apos;re filming the real wreck .
1065	and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be formed about songs .
3248	and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , what happens to people who are moving to california in hopes to become happier .
6339	&quot; moneyball &quot; appears soon and turns to statistics , and to use it to have a great baseball team .
6379	and it was my mission when the emergency staff was searching for kardiological advice to investigate the emergency patient .
2606	in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as a propulsion fuel .
5015	there would be a way to live in a city that would be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
682	so i raised my view of the manuscript , and i spoke to my commentary towards the empty corner of the room .
2390	from these two experiences , a whole new world has been achieved , a whole new world of creativity for filmmaking .
14	and just as the biosphere was heavily discarded , this was happening with the ethnosphere -- only at even greater speed .
2009	that means , if you &apos;re seven percent renewable , you &apos;re not going to be able to do it without any storage .
2293	so you can see that in this way , looking at information and data is very much reminiscent of swimming in a vibrating information graph .
5168	it turns out we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to simplify it .
4009	i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it feels like science is self-sufficient .
4125	and when computers are free , they start to react in other ways , they are perceived and driven .
1959	this is the cruel getting back-up , and the wind , the sun is using the burden so that they can make the larger percentage .
1967	but if you want to assemble multiple of these interactions , and they &apos;re supposed to build a web , it &apos;s very complicated .
1950	the world &apos;s energy hunger , which is going to be solved with this one , because you don &apos;t need permission .
2673	and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could make it easy .
1691	because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me , because i can &apos;t cook .
4771	they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , they didn &apos;t have any control over the finished product .
5931	she said , &quot; your mom &apos;s my baby , and you have to promise you &apos;re going to take care of you all the time . &quot;
3158	the stories of the reflection were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
2797	i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back in time before cars were cars , or twitter , or &quot; america is looking for the superstar . &quot;
4208	all the kids from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
3864	and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
3977	and if you look at , for example , the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
3247	now , because the thinking self is responsible , you can end up -- some people could actually pull to california at the end .
4272	as the iceberg melts , it releases mineral liquid drinking water , which feeds a lot of life forms .
968	and that &apos;s not in the hobbyregion , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot of things .
403	now we &apos;re trying to ask , can we regenerate life , or can we create new life from this digital universe ?
3743	or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for other of us ?
4911	this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
6679	if you &apos;re being suspected in a crime , then pretty much , your phone is being tapped .
5872	a child in london shows the picture of a food and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fog today . &quot;
4758	and you can also see it here , target , wii , mini , from mini coopers and jetblue .
428	design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be missing .
5816	i was under the stars sky in the desert with sufi singers mukhtiar ali .
6541	this is a story that we &apos;ve heard a lot of times from the galapagos islands or other places , and it &apos;s not very special .
6631	let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks into categories .
3171	and that &apos;s true of the stories that memory provides us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
429	when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate was at a 10,000 base pairs error .
2741	so what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
2647	we need to have dialogue more rational and more complete , and also the things that are undertaken by the government .
668	he just looked up in the sky and said , well , excuse me , can &apos;t you see that i &apos;m driving the car ?
6152	that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , about entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
747	and the west antarctica , which has popped up over a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melting .
13	it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are capable of as an astonishing species of knowledge .
840	then , after about 30 seconds , you get mixed again , and you have a new letter combination and new possibilities to try out .
3935	now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , who are two people in a body .
3656	i mean , think , when antonio damasio asks for your self-image , do you think about the bacteria ?
4877	and i think , in closing , is the main thing for me that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
2262	a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of crisis inequalities in the distribution , not of overall production .
6039	if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult topics , then the positive and wonderful things are affected .
2139	there was a long break in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
3491	i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what happened to me a few months ago when i wrote an article for wired italian .
2089	robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen unnecessarily the cellists .
6573	the reason is going to change . for -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is becoming more mashous .
3720	the following year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in it , up to four months .
4067	i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i &apos;ve been packing here for this exciting week at ted .
3642	but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it also about the future ?
5886	to be here at ted , to see and to hear how stimulating this is , i &apos;ve given a lot of power .
3536	and i don &apos;t want to use it at all ; i don &apos;t want to force the impact of the fight of a human being .
3704	a second way is that it will be a evolution of the traditional way , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
5041	there are 700 million people around the world who say that they want to live permanently in a different place .
610	the romans had the same idea , what they called the sort of embodied creative mind , the original genius .
1419	and the great thing about this is , the dropout rate goes back to the favelas about ninety-nine percent .
1676	sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
2473	for me , it was more a principle way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
4813	a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
6115	there was a crazy line of time that in this country there &apos;s nothing more to compute that there &apos;s only misbehavior .
1964	there &apos;s a little scale , so you can also use your rasizers in the car over a little bit of a change .
4900	so we go out and play with it , and then we look at how it reacts , and then we start to develop our intuition there .
5935	and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is , &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
5538	and chicago has just launched it , so that people can unleash the burial sticks if they sniff .
5120	those who really want to make a choice are offered 20 fonds , not 300 or more fund .
3942	it also applies to race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our terminology allowed .
6720	so all you have to do is connect a blue and a green one together , and you can build really quickly larger cycles .
5809	so we &apos;re the amounts , and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
6009	i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of reconstruction , all the way to the beginning of world war ii .
6043	but eventually , these realities are overwhelmed by suffering , abuse , replacement , exclamation .
3787	as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and argue with them .
5204	again , just a tiny percentage of it will ever be viral , and it will look at thousands of times , and at the cultural moment .
3608	but only those who were still in school -- aside from the students who had cut school .
5556	now there &apos;s a large community of people who are creating the tools that we need to effectively pack things together .
6252	this is why the dome of the washington monument was made for aluminum .
5317	and it was my job to stay awake every night until their nightmares came so i could wake them up .
5550	it shows how government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think it should be .
5060	do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes of category versus the one hour of category ?
6437	it &apos;s the one who tells you that not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but that you &apos;re bad for yourself .
3842	and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that the trees are shaking .
2867	there are questions and problems with the people we thought they were always right , so be skeptical .
62	in a blood-battered continent , these were the only people who were never conquered by the spaniards .
5003	i was asked to go to tegucigalpa and have another talk on the fourth and the fifth of january .
4710	part of the hippie , part of yogi , part of the brooklyn-girl -- i don &apos;t know .
804	a plan to bring america back to work , make us safer and help stop global warming .
299	they &apos;re offering 50 investment funds -- 10 percent less employees than if they &apos;re just offering five . why ?
1207	but that &apos;s an essential component , if you want to design things in a very , very intuitive way .
4205	and here you see me when i was trying to do the testing of the sensors opening the water , not getting wet .
958	this is another project , which is from the french group out of paris , which has happened , which is pretty cool .
1175	you then work on it , even during the study , with the subject of perception and the perceptual psychology .
5440	and yeah , i even killed the house up on the island in red to make it look swedish .
1898	he &apos;s just interested in keeping himself in the need to prove that there is predictive .
6236	four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started a new university at ted called singularity university .
5415	but in a certain way , combined with each other , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional , as if it exists .
3770	and pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a brainstorm , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
2132	well , he mentioned some algae and some fish meals , and then he said , chicken pellets .
4820	and while i was working for google , i was trying to make this desire -- to make art accessible -- to bring technology together .
132	the trailers of their sleeds were originally made out of fish that was wrapped in caribbean skin .
5082	there are more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
2484	but in art and in exploration , failure has to be an alternative , because it guarantees a trust plan there .
131	now you have to know that the inuit has no fear of the cold . they used it to their advantage .
2542	almost every manufacturing method for electricity today emitts co2 , except for renewables and nuclear energy .
866	and you can put these sounds in the sequence , which you can then order in any pattern .
6008	and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students african american history . i talk about slavery .
1905	i have to say honestly , you got it , it was difficult for me to start talking about my idea .
3756	of course , this leads to some major complications -- injury , 30 percent of them -- chronic injury .
5954	i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m standing that i &apos;ve never drunk a drop of alcohol .
584	norman mailer just said before he died in his last interview , and each of my books killed me a little further .
5179	the other half of the client goes from the low possible , four gears , to the 56 autocolor , many possibilities .
487	we need over five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
3395	they have more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other subject in any other wiki in the world .
493	we now have technologies because of these fast synthesia methods to do what we call combinatorial genetics .
2580	these are power farms , you &apos;re talking about lots of square kilometers , thousands of times more land than a normal power plant .
5645	this slide shows us an analysis of the performance of risc processors compared to the power of a local area network .
6388	i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , which is water pills , so that they go out of the liquid .
5852	and so every book and every world becomes a little murmute that i &apos;m going to draw here to the magic device in the machine .
4392	we looked at them , we laughed , we were crying , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
4038	and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like or could have looked like , if we had the mothers more involved .
4236	but then once we have all the imagery , you can play with it , and play with color , gravity and motion .
649	she caught the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took it over to the sheet of paper .
4453	i realized at the time by connecting the dots to each other that life is just about being a great father .
6458	two days later , i came to my next emergency service , and my editor asked me to have a conversation in her office .
5847	i mean , not magic and dragons , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
1020	but i &apos;m going to go back to that in a second and show you through an attempt to prove that you also have a natural relationship to virtuality .
4781	i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that our worldview challenges .
5665	either it becomes a classic curve like this , until something completely new comes in , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
658	and how do we relate to this without losing our minds , but keeping us in the opposite , even in mental health ?
2598	vinod khosla investes in dozens of companies doing great things , and i try to support this .
2428	no one had ever explored the inside of the wreck . you didn &apos;t have any tools for it , so we developed the technology necessary .
3342	when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have plus-1 talking and + one crazy idea , plus 20 crazy idea .
5980	my home state of alabama withdraws the right to the election if they &apos;re sententially convicted .
5289	after a four-year-old and a four-year film , saga glitt filmed a boat on the sea as a fishing boat .
105	it &apos;s not change and technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the glory .
6362	the truth is that nobody in medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a rescue should be .
1409	and so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers were going to the cities , and the cities had to keep getting their nutrients all the time .
5340	i met people in all their lives , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the limits of the possible .
6638	there are several known cases of online millionaires , multimillionaires that have earned their money from attacks .
897	there are now craig venter in the united states , who &apos;s trying to make biofuel , which is gasoline from algae .
934	so anybody who &apos;s been screwed up a soup he &apos;s made for too long , even .
6189	the fact is that the media preferred to show us negative subjects because our minds pay attention to these topics .
226	the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more public good they have .
3294	in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase this time .
3064	one colored capsule , which is at one end of yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
5924	she sat me down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i was watching you . &quot;
5829	it became a golden access to a world of pirates and unfortunate ships and images in my imagination .
1970	they &apos;re going to have to go more on a seasonal memory and winter summer and not just a day-night .
3122	it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we &apos;re using it to many different things .
3853	now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage straight from the wild .
4589	now if you had asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this in a certain way .
5062	today i want to talk about one of the biggest decision-making problems of our modern time , the decision-making problem .
4200	and if it &apos;s indian , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can actually put the roof down .
3410	so , he says , it &apos;s completely logical at the moment that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
1663	a child who hasn &apos;t learned the singing , because the parents didn &apos;t make it , will not do it by themselves .
3744	are we going to be a society of dialarity and uniformers , or robuster and many robuster ?
1714	i think the stream would have been thrilled if he &apos;d had the clear possibility of modern piano today .
3218	and , by the way , we &apos;re now capable of getting a pretty good idea from the luck of the living self over time .
2268	our cornco chamber is threatened today , not because of deceptive impacts , but because of depleting resources .
4646	you see , if you put transparency in google search , this is -- this is one of the first images , this appears .
6402	and the nurse thought about it , and he said , in fact , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to do well . &quot;
2229	i said , &quot; miguel , do you fly 240 miles to the farm and then fly back 240 miles in the evening ?
5459	it works very simply : every time i jump on the scale , it will send my data to google health .
5834	when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that readers all over the world can connect .
118	the suffering of tibets can be intolerable , but the devastating mind of man is something unforgettable .
3601	in the 1960s , in the united kingdom , they did a case study , and that was when gymnasia was done in total schools .
235	we can assemble 6.5 million different stereo plants from the components that are offered in this business .
3439	and geologists found evidence of a global cooling , which took nearly 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
677	when i heard this story , it also changed the way i worked and it saved me a little bit .
1632	i play the play every few years now , and it &apos;s changed for me , although not a single note has changed .
430	we found 30 errors when we rescued it , and if we had the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up .
2074	he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i otherwise know from my colleagues in the philharmony of los angeles .
4048	but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there could be some female in feminism .
3460	we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve since joined them over the last three years .
2310	what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia sheet and reduced it to a small summary .
2187	and then he goes and falls into more of the rare birds and algae and strange water plants .
5347	there was a energy , an inbiting optimism , a strange mixture of humility and the org .
3547	but most importantly , it &apos;s that between the perception of our inadequacy and our great ingenuity , there is a connection .
4342	and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
538	in one of the connections , between a thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a factory defect .
3180	and yet , somehow they get the impression that they should count that what happened during this sight of life is our lives .
615	the artist of the ages was protected in certain things , like , too much narcissm , right ?
2030	and at this point , people are always going to come and look at our subjects on this , sort of our island subjects .
2236	and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in southern spain , she didn &apos;t even tap into fish skin at all .
329	but one important point that he &apos;s doing is , whoever you choose to do something , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
5568	now , after two years , i came to the conclusion that it was all about community communities to do thylacines .
1515	so , when i invite you to eat and say , this is free of chicken , it doesn &apos;t help you .
4221	or infrequently , in three dimensions , in which the light is changing , is not the position of the imagery .
3884	and in the other case , the sperm is a x chromosome hitting the x chromosome of the egg cell .
5366	i just dug in a hotel room in sydney when she died , 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
388	poor fantasy , a brief view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i first read it .
4677	we &apos;re going to be equipped for both men and women -- solid , roll-on , or a stick , whatever .
485	we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
3349	but to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , our first primate ancestors started to get upright .
3008	it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our non-worthy , and we really have to stop that .
3972	now they did that part because they were part of an educational system where two things grew together .
5212	last year , bear vasquez sent this video he &apos;d shot in front of his house in the yosemite national park .
2243	okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that measures its success in the success of their predators .
6562	my third little story tells me about my involvement in the introduction of trawling fisheries in southeast asia .
4481	and after we experimented with different kinds of cheese , it occurred to me that this is a targeted attack .
1768	we need this place to have these lies that will sustain us deception without that we can &apos;t live on .
4029	in our endeavors around democracy , we did really well , and i think we would do well in the future .
1084	and they have been described more and more over the centuries in the course of the machine age by the influencers of the machine age .
1029	they go through this house in the mind , where they live , and they look at how many doors there are .
4432	and i regretted the time i wasted for meaningless things , with people who mean something .
1769	we not only have art , in human history , but also in science , great lies like that .
2255	we love weekly markets . we love small family businesses . we talk about local food . we eat bio .
4121	and basically , it &apos;s a system that consists of two parts -- a sensing part and a reacting arrow .
369	and so the visual attraction is that we generally do better , objective , and we feel worse .
4652	but why ? well , transparency is frightening -- like this strange bear who still breaks .
3157	and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the reflection as a patient b .
5555	and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
4040	for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in intersexuality , i &apos;ve been interested in research in gender gaps .
960	he then built this helmet there , and in the cooperation with the museum , that &apos;s gone .
1612	it &apos;s exciting , because what happens then is things that we haven &apos;t tried that way , and what you can &apos;t sample .
3764	now let &apos;s look at the wheelchair drivers , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
1064	they have no lead-land maps , but they have used these called songlines , or traumatic plumes .
4225	here you see a real fluyfire-controlling that comes down to shape the same violin .
4499	so what we first found was systems function calls , because we know what they were doing .
142	an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can search and achieve repeatedly with its inhabitants .
1413	you &apos;ve just done civilization for over five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring the nutrients back .
1179	and what actually means , intuitively , and how do our channels of perception work , and how does the cognitive processing work ?
809	one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on the old , dirty fuels that we create in our world .
1757	the artist shares something to you , and above all , this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see when she just looks in the mirror .
1446	it &apos;s not about making the existing slightly less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
4977	imagine that half the people who want to live in apartments did this already ; the other half didn &apos;t do it yet .
4034	i said to him , &quot; well , did you consider political asyl rather than having an operation to separate it ? &quot;
1115	and that &apos;s what i thought is that i &apos;m exploring the outside world , so i &apos;m exploring the real world again .
2717	a few years ago , at ted , peter skillman presented a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
4776	and we drove to school districts where companies are going to build their way to poor schools all over america .
4007	so we have these permanent anatomic categories that are problematic and questionable in many ways .
4000	heinrich , on the other hand , is born to the birthday min , so he was born on march 1 , 1980 .
2381	and what came out was the first computer-generated software surfing character ever to see in a movie .
6609	we &apos;re going to restore the past that people can &apos;t grasp because the standard values have changed and are very low .
6411	other medical professionals are also afraid of this , but the emergency care is particularly special because we only see the patients fleeting like this .
4325	we also flown seven programmers from around the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- home to us .
4732	all these things come and start from a place , and they come to me and they start with my family in west virginia .
5315	my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other about our day , and we listened to the movement of our grandmother in the house .
2589	this is what happens when you try to get these interrupted sources of what we say about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
704	and maybe no one will ever call god &apos;s name again , if he spins , but what will he do with the rest of his life ?
731	the so-called thumb ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood coming out of the body here .
1362	and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilizing the human population .
5492	the other thing we want to ask for is that companies around the world help us confirm these aeds .
371	this is the official dogma that we all think is right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
6283	and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
1219	so a very , very exciting process of how certain things go off and what happens for millisecond areas of these things .
376	there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard a lot of them whose problem is not too big choice .
4213	so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical imagery , the imagery of water , and the projections on it .
3779	i was 24 years old , and in the best form , when a monstrous pink tree was paralyzed while a skiing ride was paralyzed .
3118	but despite all this flow of work , there are several cognitive falling , which is sort of almost impossible to think about happiness .
5715	this communication now allowed the reason of communities that were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were synthetic .
5787	and so i can have evolution going through over millions of years in the computer within just a few minutes , or more complicated cases , a few hours .
2614	and if you make ocean water cheap and easy to film , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s lifetime .
1292	that &apos;s what everybody &apos;s doing all the time , but it &apos;s making it unconscious , and it &apos;s sort of intuitive or partial .
3447	so , they sent half of their civilization to look for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion game hours a week .
1190	so much more natural , in a pot , but i see sort of where is salt and pepper in it .
1166	not when i think local ecologically here , and the neighbor is thinking less ecologically , the whole thing doesn &apos;t work anymore .
386	in closing , please read this cartoon , and , you know , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
4366	everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible at some point .
4818	i became a great education part -- i didn &apos;t complain -- but i didn &apos;t have access to many museums and these works of art .
5625	now the average age of our field is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
4825	there &apos;s the uffizi , the moma , the hermitage , the rijks , the van gogh .
138	and this , in many ways , is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the indigenous in the world .
5995	the other perspective is not : did somebody deserve death for a crime , but did we deserve to kill ?
311	the more possibilities there are , the more easy it is to regret at all , that &apos;s disappointing for the choice you make .
6158	here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to have a billion dollars for the death penalty , a billion dollars .
5674	now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you find that the future is still in 2000 .
2681	you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is a different approach .
2945	but you know , this is really a serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it .
1760	here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to stabilize our lifespan .
5303	and the lacks of broken english were swapped between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
6369	and i learned in my little dge in the nurse residence at the toronto general hospital , far from here .
5195	and the more we are selectively selective , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
5286	my mother mai was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two little girls .
3337	we don &apos;t have that easy in real life , that feeling that if you have a fingernap there is ready for employees .
5412	i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality .
6565	i was driving along , and we were doing yearning in the entire southern south china sea , and particularly in the javasee .
535	now , the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
736	professor katey walter at university in alaska has traveled to another group of people to another flat lake last winter .
4874	very simply , you go in -- and i created this , which is the power of the zoom -- you can zoom in .
267	that means every day you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
5427	and these two pictures are filling these two demands out of the same altitude and the same type of illumination .
3809	we wore our estimates outside the house owner , where , not surprisingly , he got a lot more attention than mine .
6710	i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
1880	now we can go back to the second sentence and say , if wolf singer &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no willingness .
3820	not every day , we &apos;ll have a chance to save the life of a human being , but every day it &apos;s offering us the opportunity to change one .
1040	in this head , knowledge has been called , and with these virtual images , the imagination , they &apos;ve just been given away knowledge .
2374	this seemed to be the best way to tell my inner ring to tell stories , with my need to create images , to unite .
3419	according to herodotus , games were actually invented more specifically in the kingdom of lydics during a famine .
1697	over time , they get some claims , and they want some more spices there , or even tastes out fine differences .
3398	ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome : players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
2601	the development stopped in this industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
5817	we talked about the fact that nothing has changed since the era of the ancient indian epos &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
6145	during the break , a police officer came in , and it was disturbing that the janitor was in the courthouse .
298	and what she found was every 10 investment fund that was offering employers , took the participation by two percent .
6057	i want to warn you . this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
3476	when you close the game , you get the world bank award , you get the award , &quot; social reference , &quot; in 2010 .
4933	for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a swimming pool shaped hole and the thing .
4347	at the end of it , he sent us an e-mail with follow-up content : &quot; for the first time , for seven years , i drew something .
4134	in a sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom out there becomes both , a sensor and a driver .
6203	and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in the long run , but ultimately getting over them .
273	it &apos;s because they &apos;re involved in other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry now ?
3274	is there a chance that politicians would generally take a fund like this seriously and make politics based on this ?
5428	and thirdly , it &apos;s about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images start and end by connecting them seamlessly .
3161	and the one that &apos;s worse was where the pain was at the very end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
5450	and one of the things that we introduced at the orboud university was to make a major listener .
3808	i wore my prey back to the bottom , where i met my enemy on my front door , and the beloved dog .
6691	and as we are today , in 2011 , our governments may be trusted , every right that we &apos;re spending is abandoned forever .
5035	it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that managers are allowed to participate , and it &apos;s also done on an external legal system .
773	around christmas , at home in tennessee , i ran around a billion tons of coal lamb .
4474	when we started doing our research , six months ago , it was completely unknown what the meaning and purpose of this design was .
1758	the artist shared with you in such a portrait what you &apos;re only going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of art over and over again .
3244	if you ask this question , you think that people in california have to be happier if they are , say , living in ohio .
1256	that &apos;s where we &apos;re more likely to be at the level of symbolic , at the level of meaning that we are , of course , interested in as a form .
3420	there was supposed to be such a great famine that the king of poetry decided to be a crazy idea .
5409	but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done in a two-dimensional space .
762	in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons a day into the oceans .
880	and then finally , i can make the whole sequence by pinching the volume of lauty-sizeable to the left .
6697	they put us in the shoes of building things bigger than us , buildings , bridges , one stone after another .
5768	to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that comes from random instructions .
6281	my goodness , we &apos;re soon going to reach the 70 percent decoding rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
6315	and it &apos;s a game where individuals can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
2707	if the dish that you get is a very high-power embodied , then only the rich people can keep up .
1613	it &apos;s great fun to make music this way , and then you , as the audience , have seen the way music communicates alive .
1192	and on the left , just intuitively , and then i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in it , that salt gives it accordingly .
583	and even those who didn &apos;t actually make it suicide seemed to have been really neglected by their talents .
6723	take the switch out to put a pulse valve , which is here , and you made a little blind man .
5065	when i ask you a question , raise your hand as i &apos;m blind , just your hand , if you want to burn some calories .
6258	ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with 5,000-times more energy than we use every year .
385	income distribution is going to make it possible for everybody to do better -- not just the poor -- because all this big choice is going to be us .
4564	ralph , it &apos;s been reported a lot , that people suspect that the mossad is the main organization behind it .
3897	i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of the possible types of gender variants that don &apos;t confront the male or female standard .
45	their hunter-gatherers could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what animal species was .
632	maybe we can &apos;t eliminate the thought well from 500 years of rational humanism just in an 18-minute talk .
3929	typically , our system is based on the idea that a particular anatomic exploitation has a particular identity .
758	and the disasters around the world have taken on a really extraordinary and unprecedented scale before .
539	so the wires actually heat up slightly , and 13-thousand ampere suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
5537	and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the depleted gullys .
4489	and we also noticed that they were very professional , from people who obviously had all the insiders available .
914	but it &apos;s really always about finding such a lockier way of having that kind of a playful transition with it .
5698	they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , in a certain chemical form , which we call dna .
3082	i &apos;m going to now put this needle in my skin and push through it , until it came back out on the other side .
5697	in any way that we don &apos;t fully understand , these droplets have learned the ability to write information down .
4430	in my own humanity and with my failures , i aspired to be better at anything i was packing .
1017	archaic cognitive models are the models that we used in the pre-industrial times .
1215	i &apos;ve got cognitive feedback , you &apos;ve proven what you want to see .
3867	this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos offers us in our past and present .
1094	we had the vocal age , we had the machine age , and we now described this so-called cyber-age .
352	no one in the world of marketing knows this , because if you did , all of you would not know what this is all about .
4934	this thing has the ability to be in the quantum mechanical superposition , but it needs a little help to do it .
2099	one day , the head of the company called and asked if i could make a session about the sustainability of the farm .
4192	and you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you can see in this picture .
3501	so i immediately started calling myself the online copy of 2009 and expecting me to find a more proper post here .
3309	and when they get there , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually capable of doing this . this is an epic victory .
2191	so i interrupted it . i said , &quot; miguel , how does your fish taste so well ? &quot;
1367	if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the earth , the ants weigh about four times more than us humans .
946	it was quite intuitive , so everybody just expressed his wishes , his and what made him stop , then .
4902	so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can only be in a place at the same time .
3237	we know that happiness is mainly about being satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
5005	this is a picture of the city denver , and the sketch represents the new airport built in denver .
1603	it has to be coherent to me here and now , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
6624	and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west how anyone could do that , and how much that would affect the freedom of speech .
560	for example , they get very worried about me and they say , &quot; don &apos;t you worry you &apos;re never going to overcome that success ?
2246	and when it fought through the system , and the water is cleaner than the way it came in .
1310	that &apos;s why all of you who are here and are curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
5682	because i think in order to really understand this , we need to step back and look at the thing on a longer scale of time .
6468	there &apos;s a lot of stuff going on , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that only had 14 patients a night .
5803	we &apos;re now using these programs to make the computers much faster , so we &apos;re able to do these processes even faster .
5735	so the nervous system has the evolutionary process with this particular information structure , because evolution could now take place within an individual .
3466	so for the next world &apos;s game , we have a bigger , higher goal than just oil scarcity .
2145	it &apos;s the romantic species , the way in which you know your fish , the better you learn your fish , the more you love your fish .
1717	today , a modern orchestra is capable of playing everything that an orchestra of then has turned out to be unthinkable .
1574	today , i want to show you what else i use musically , which is interpreting , again , into a verbal language .
6296	and only by the way , the largest disinsurance against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition all over the world .
5648	and this is a novelty that we have to use this guy scale on semi-logarithmic curves in the field of technology .
3759	soldat : with the hulc exoskeleton , i can carry 200 pounds of different type terrain for many hours .
3470	the call to gamers , we almost created a &quot; jerry bruckheimer &quot; film .
4792	one of the things i believe about is that when you get your chance , you take risks in these risks .
2008	we can start on the island even asking for electric mobility , rumbling , because you can manage the burden .
537	so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the room between the stars , these wires can bear the tension .
3595	see , it really needs only one person to show you how to manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
21	each language is like an old-standing forest of the mind , a turning point , an idea , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
1710	and what happens when you play a piece today that was initially written a hundred years ago , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
1930	and we just started asking a relatively simplistic story , where could you use a memory meaningful today ?
3377	players always believe that an epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and it &apos;s the same .
949	and we even tried to get that back into the academic world , but there &apos;s sort of no way there .
3851	and if you look at bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human salmon , dance and from rituals .
3448	we should figure out that half of us spend an hour each day playing games until we solve the problems of the real world .
4439	the third thing that i learned -- while the interior clock starts counting , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 ... &quot;
3404	and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be witness-less than a mass migration in virtual worlds and online play environments . &quot;
4321	and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve done some things .
2536	in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction by a factor three or maybe even a factor six .
3333	but always on the edge of your skill , so you have to strain , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
2472	there were people who thought we &apos;d actually done these oceans well and transported them on the planet pandora .
2826	and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world go hungry to bed every day .
3319	we &apos;re doing more in the game worlds . i mean , i mean , in the context of motivation , to do something significant , to collaborate with each other .
2633	they really go through it and create a framework where this can be discussed , because we need support from all sides .
6363	what we do , though , is that we send each of them , including me , to the world out to be perfect with the claim .
703	it &apos;s just an aging mortality with painful knees , and maybe it will never go back to those heights .
3283	well , it seems to me that this topic , or should at least be the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years .
1253	there are , once in a way , the practical functions , so formal aspects or formalaesthetic aspects .
3033	i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will be held through my mere physical magnetism .
4131	this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli , for moma , later , organized in the year , during the summer .
853	he can bring new characters into the scene by picking up the character from the table , showing this character .
5940	and then he took a swallow beer and offered my sister one , and she assumed , and then they offered me one .
251	health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
6705	lego basically took the concrete building block , the building block of the world , and made it a building block for our imagination .
4525	but anyway , what we found was that both digital warheads were actually directing one and the same goal , but out of different directions .
6227	and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are all available .
1303	i can get the whole overview , and i can now filter it up and say , just show me all of the chocolate things .
8	all these people are teaching us that there are other possibilities of existence , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting on earth .
2251	you could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about barsh or meat cattle .
6126	i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
2383	according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , advanced technology and magic are no longer different from each other .
3511	even describing a human being mindless than a child , could reach out to constrain them and to impose ideas about them .
5908	and when i said no , she hugged me again , and when i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she let me quiet .
622	for the first time in history , you hear people call this genius or the artist -- instead of having a genius .
4002	heinrich has to wait for all this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the time he was born .
879	so i don &apos;t have to plan them in the field , but i can improvise ; they stretch or shorter at the end of the day .
588	do you feel it ? because it &apos;s only a centimeter away -- i don &apos;t feel comfortable with this notion at all .
3952	they were at least holding a spring under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
3022	and i &apos;m going to show you how it works , and this is a trick that has been in every magic book for children in the 1950s .
5621	do we really believe that we have to achieve what we need to do without improving the institution that can act on behalf of us ?
2736	and peter says , &quot; none of the kids are investing in being the head of the spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
1547	just when you take these winds , they shrink , they sterilize and they take the powder to plant the trees .
6491	and there &apos;s the idea that if we ban the people who make errors out of medicine , we will have a secure system .
1336	if we think of the weighs to the bathroom , then all of our earth is going to be , sooner or later , a cemetery .
4146	some of you will remember it was playing as italy against france , and then at the end of the cidane , the head gun .
6093	i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
2117	&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish is not concentrated . &quot;
358	i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- that i &apos;m married to a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
2156	and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way they and i understand it .
6277	the head of coca-cola has just agreed to launch a big test project with a hundred units in the developing world .
1878	and if we &apos;re here in frfurt on the main , i remember the max plank institute for brain research .
5359	she grew up at a time when confucianism was the social norm and the local mandarin was the most important person .
2356	my response to that was the drawing and painting of aliens , alien worlds , robots , spaceships and all that sort of thing .
6708	like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more complex circles , one stone after the other .
4166	now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
3678	i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who introduced his show in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
6017	and after terrorism , of course , the rape and decades of rapidly motivated submission and apartheid emerged .
6584	on the y-axis are some good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of your country , the water supply .
395	but the hanging off of a metaphorical goldfish jar is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , catastrophe .
2930	they take this stuff , and they take alternative cures , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find out they &apos;re useless .
5973	we have a legal system in this country that they treat much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
2583	that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re dependent on those sources , you have to have a way to get the energy in time when it &apos;s not available .
98	so it turns out that you take each of the 17 varieties on the full moon , and they sing you in a variety of tons .
6131	it touched something deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute to each individual , to a community , to a perspective of hope .
6218	that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your pocket costs about a million times less , and it &apos;s thousands of times faster than a supercomputer in the &apos; 70s .
3950	we have very difficult conversations today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question of when someone is dead .
5673	when i was another child , the future was somewhere in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
5719	at this point , we have multi-cellular communities , communities of many different cell types that act together as a single organism .
5947	and then he looked at me in the face and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re still going to make you crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
2084	the power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and took care of him .
6124	when i rented the staircase to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitor in the court .
3960	so to tell you about this tension , i have to first know that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
3618	suppose , through a few changes in your genes , you could have a better memory -- more precise , more precise and faster .
1761	and not just in art , in volcanic terms , in the mythology , it appears again in stories .
3307	an epic victory is a result that is so positive that you didn &apos;t know it was possible at all .
1636	he translated the seeroses in a different way that he saw them , as they did at that moment .
2443	at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was again the science fiction from my childhood .
575	is it logical that he should be expected by someone , that he &apos;s afraid to do the work he feels up to ?
5399	or photographs like this -- dark and colorful at the same time , but all with the common goal of keeping a realistic level .
3240	the conclusion from what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness as a sales of well-being .
530	in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew the machine was working , which is a big triumph .
950	so i think we &apos;re from the biohackerscene , in fact , a step further than the academic world .
227	this is , i think , proven so deeply in our water supply , that no one would ever make sense of it .
4380	my circle started back in the &apos; 60s at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the classroom pig .
2599	nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that might surprisingly follow the nuclear approach .
96	and then you ask them how to do their taxonomy , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
4982	so i proposed that governments create new areas that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
5588	and the next entry that we got was going , &quot; i went over there , found the trash pitch behind the house .
263	the answer is , they expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change in the prescription .
2482	they &apos;re worried about you . don &apos;t do you do it yourself , don &apos;t hurt you against yourself . they take risks on you . &quot;
3252	it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how difficult it is .
2058	he had just heard a demo from beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and he came behind the stage to imagine himself .
533	about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- these golden wires here .
2021	if you don &apos;t have that anymore , that rotating mass , you &apos;ve got to replace that with productional electronics and electrochemistry .
6116	the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i &apos;d dreamed this crazy post or actually wrote it .
3392	here &apos;s a background formation to put that on the right , and you know all wikipedia , the world &apos;s largest wiki .
4250	the cloud is again a cloud of imagery , in the same way as a real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
644	she knew that she could only do one of those things at that moment , and that was -- in her words , like the devil and the devil .
903	computers hack , and then it &apos;s always going to be in the media , yeah , the hackers kind of break in and steal data and so forth .
3182	and how we used it would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that holds the memory itself for us .
6079	i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; mmhmm . mmmm . mmhmm . &quot;
1050	shamanas , priests , called knowledge waters , were extra to preserve knowledge in stories .
372	there &apos;s no question that there &apos;s something better than no choice , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice is better than choice .
5700	the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information has stayed the time of 2.5 billion years where it came from .
4090	sometimes people say to me , i look like i dress , or i remember them in their seven-year-old .
1159	now this completely confuses us , of course , because we see on the one hand the new media , social media , facebook and so forth .
2188	and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community got unlocked , that way .
749	in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes up there , which were glaciers a few years ago .
6734	the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that surround them in the day-to-day life , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
3259	i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup poll is a number that we absolutely didn &apos;t expect to find .
6652	groups like anonymous have gone up over the last 12 months and have become one of the main players in the field of online attacks .
5197	hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-managers on youtube . i look at youtube videos .
1119	and that &apos;s because i &apos;m exploring a city by looking at the places that have been positively or negatively twittered .
5748	and it connects us all to something that &apos;s much bigger , and it &apos;s also able to evolve faster than we &apos;ve been .
350	adding opportunities into human life increases inevitably the expectations people have about how good these possibilities will be .
6553	there were bombardians of about 20 inches , black jelly brothers , a kind of shelter .
4396	what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation i talked about .
445	we knew about a homologous recombination mechanism that uses biology to repair dna that could do those things .
2812	a child born in new delhi today will expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
5157	if you think the one on the left is swing , and the one on the right is jazz , you clap your hands .
5159	if you think the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing , please clap .
458	this is over 580,000 letters in genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure ever made by human beings .
3988	again , people from different skin paint , working on anatomic commonalities before anatomic differences , again , successful .
3694	it doesn &apos;t necessarily prioritize the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
6404	so i signed the abandoned papers and a hospital and rescue assistant and brought them home .
5729	they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
1395	we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
730	as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue , this is the annual ice in the winter , and it &apos;s shrinking in summer .
2334	it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes the big picture bigger than the sum of the file .
2134	he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , bone flour , reste , cheated and processed to feed . &quot;
4720	now , we can &apos;t all be the tom-brand , but i often see myself in the intersection of dark glamour and lousy fly .
4390	and i should mention that i have pancreatic cancer , and i want you to go , please . &quot;
6046	for me , the time to stop thinking and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , the ones that will never be at ted .
5662	the question i &apos;d like to ask you now is , if you look at these exponential curves , you can see they &apos;re not going on forever .
439	we &apos;ve engineered the pieces so that we could just break them up with enzymes , and there are enzymes that are repairing them and putting them back together .
4274	it &apos;s not a death when you melt ; it &apos;s not an end , it &apos;s an advance of your path along the life cycle .
932	this is actually not necessary , because each of the coffeemaker actually has more sophisticated technology than most laboratories , which is really the case .
4794	i believe that if you train your employees to avoid taking risks , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit from the whole company .
824	more importantly , they &apos;re physical , which is why you can move them like building blocks just from the outside of your hand and reach out .
3675	and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome continues , the rest of the body becomes devastating .
5258	since this was completely surprising , and humorous , casey niestats &apos;s funny idea , and his argument looked at five million times .
1295	now i can just design this mental action model , select , inform , translate it to an interaction system .
5139	which brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of decision making , which is concrete .
4389	can you please come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know you &apos;ve found him in between .
3928	the reason they &apos;re often used to doing different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
6209	and charles kenny , the literacy rate , in the past 130 years , has gone from 25 percent to 80 percent .
1587	you read in the letters , the thugs , the notes , or whether there are words , thoughts of the composers themselves .
4665	i have friends who make great , gigantic hollywood films , and i have friends who make small , you know , little , independence movies like me .
3757	so we thought that we would take this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this problem .
1176	and that &apos;s also , of course , where you start and look and say , okay , i &apos;m just going to look inside yourself .
2777	the reason is , i create help digital tools and processes to help teams create cars , video games and visual effects .
6237	we teach our students all these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
3211	why we choose the holidays that we choose is a problem that we have with a choice between the two species of self .
883	and today i &apos;ve had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the ways that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
2652	thank you very much . just to understand terrapower a little better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
921	here on the lower left is a group in indonesia , house-of-natural fiber called the one that has been around for quite a long time .
4127	by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the world &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
5832	and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic instead of killing .
2587	so what we need here is a great breakthrough , something that is going to be a factor 100 better than the approaches at the moment .
6215	the richest capitalists of the last century , the imperators of the earth , could never have dreamed of such luxury goods .
4269	when you look at an iceberg , it &apos;s easy to think that they &apos;re isolated , separate and alone , as we often see humans .
2013	if we turn this one off , you don &apos;t have this crude mass that causes a certain amount of dreaming in the net .
842	these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i was able to get them to try it out , and i took a video of it .
6045	because we &apos;re ultimately talking about the fact that we need more hope , more commitment , more commitment , to be able to exist in a complex world .
2882	catastrohal because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccination for masers is declining .
6610	so the people who see a marine protected area can benefit from the insight that it &apos;s enabling to bring back their standard values .
1315	every day , they give + give them about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to record two grams of phosphorus .
5488	and what we want to do today is not just aed4u , as the product calls itself , but also as aed4us .
5825	i was afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and no tweet to my friends .
3455	i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people to create epic victory in their own future .
2516	just different economic changes have affected it at all , and we have to go down from rapidly to slowing down and down to zero .
362	if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one that &apos;s disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
5095	and what we found was that the more fonds were offered that , indeed , the participation rate was lower .
4218	imagine a helicopter , like the one you saw earlier , that moves with other , totally synchronized .
77	i grew up in the forests of british colombia , and i believed that these forests were there to be resigned .
1321	the amazing thing is , we &apos;re looking at something that &apos;s actually called self-awareness , but it &apos;s not like that .
1181	so you really have to look in the details , if i want to make something user-friendly or intuitive , what that means in the core .
2537	but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to maybe the very best 13 billion tons , and that just isn &apos;t enough .
6377	i was resistant to a medical school hospital here in toronto as a woman , printer , to me , to the emergency office of the hospital .
5844	and again , a letter comes down for me -- and the ipad knows about gps where i live -- it &apos;s really addressed to me .
3086	so , it goes like this , right here where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little einstein .
697	they put their hands together , and they started singing : sophiallah , allah , allah , god , god , god , god .
5268	and these are not the features of the old media , and they &apos;re also not going to meet the media of today , but they &apos;re going to be determining the conversation of the future .
5275	he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life has been held together by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
1191	and when i tell someone , give me a salt or a buffer , he &apos;ll first think about where is in the right place .
238	there was a time when i was a boy , you could have any phone provider you wanted when he came from ma bell .
2487	that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to leave you with . failure is an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
3795	but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the accountable headman and find out what our tasks would be .
982	and the commercial device costs about five thousand euros up , or something like that , juvenile shelters about 50 .
5044	unfortunately , sometimes even children who are trying to find their parents again , which they , in some cases , have not seen for a decade .
3606	and of course , it destroys you to hear the heart that the other way around was told to the students that they were just enough .
1241	and then it moves into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant wait times , for example , on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
5860	we &apos;ve all heard about fees and nymps , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
925	and i have a lecture on the top of this slide in copenhagen at the medical museum combined with an exhibition on the subject .
598	these are the kinds of thoughts that can get someone to start at nine in the morning , drink gin , and i don &apos;t want that .
4930	so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal that &apos;s made like a springboard , and it &apos;s over the edge .
3288	i have a plan for it . i want to convince you more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and great games .
5338	so i talked about the inertiveness and education , and the neglect of the marginalized and disenfranchised .
3009	so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go into the future ? &quot;
4041	and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
5200	we all want to be stars -- famous , singer , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so incomplete .
1311	i &apos;m now about , practically , this whole environmental debate , the world &apos;s conversations , 40 years of club-of-rome , in quality .
5869	this is a childhood ritual being brought back . you &apos;ve got to go out to make a photograph of a flower in a chapter and tag a photograph .
1291	this is what everybody uses , and osit is an acronym , and it stands for oriented , selective , informed , transformed .
2715	bill , i think i &apos;m speaking to almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
3003	it &apos;s not our ridiculous passion for hormones , our harren on larger food , better food , unique food .
63	to this day , they are registered by a ritual priesthood , but the training to the priesthood is very extraordinary .
3654	and by talking about bacteria , you know , are all of us in our gut leading more bacteria than we have cells in the rest of our body ?
3386	you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of crafers is playing 22 hours a week , sort of as a part-time job .
1288	that means that i can just transmit an intuitive , human model of action to software and make the software much more user-friendly .
6737	so we had , for example , designers with no experience whatsoever in electronic things that started playing with littlebits as a material .
5141	why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use an ecology map or a credit card than they use on barmoney ?
3949	we have difficult conversations about what &apos;s going to become a body to be human , so that it has a different right than the fetal life .
3432	according to herodotus , after 18 years , the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided to have a last cube game .
1944	the question was simple , that was two-thousand-2006 , started the first contacts with the island , but just run through .
2449	so the circle of my existence turned out to be a science fiction fan back then as a child , and the translation into reality .
1602	every sound , every phrase , gets a sense of it , because i feel it myself , because it comes out of my own .
340	my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like the way that used to be the only species . &quot;
975	gene-gun is , yes , like a sort of airprinting pistle , which shoots about this far , two inches or so .
5349	i gathered a small team of people around me , for whom the shoe is not &quot; an immensely challenging challenge .
3836	they really came up with this , because this leads to an excellent tolerant society where lethal violence has not been seen so far .
2654	the hard step is to build the first reactor , find another billion , the regularia and the place that actually builds the first one .
497	this is a photograph of actual design software that we &apos;re working on , where you &apos;re actually sitting with , and you &apos;re designing new species on the computer .
6554	the fisheries of this bombardian were very productive , and the fishermen lived well from it , and the fishermen lived in ghana on average .
4991	the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t disturb existing housing owners .
650	in these opportunities , the poem came in and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
4908	it would be a horrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play bodily vibral , but they play these little strange particles .
5704	and i &apos;ve got 100 micrograms here of a white pulver that i try to stay in airports from security staff .
3313	i call it &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; face . and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? ok ?
3957	i &apos;m progressive , i &apos;m defending people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , i &apos;m nervous .
1762	you may know this idea of the lady who looked into the mirror every morning and asked him , who &apos;s the most beautiful thing in the entire country ?
5250	a whole remix community shot out of the ground , which made it from a stupid joke to something we can all participate in .
5094	so in these places , we had about 657 places that offered people anything between two to 59 different fonds .
5808	we got to a point where the analog is at the time when one cell organisms evolved into multi-cellular organisms .
4932	i went to a clean room with new silicon slices , and refined for 100 hours of all the big devices .
6202	now , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , biodiversity deaths , water and energy problems -- we already have .
1173	so you have to deal with that , which means that , and not just changing it , it &apos;s different , but it should also be better .
3999	let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months of age was born , so she was born on june 1 , 1980 .
323	and he spends two weeks from the thought that he pursued the opportunity to have a great parking lot day , a great parking lot .
1414	even today , when they &apos;re invited to lunch in china you &apos;re supposed to be after the food , keep it until they &apos;re searching the bathroom .
6440	he spoke to the family , and i &apos;m sure he &apos;d chew the weekends and made sure i wasn &apos;t sued .
2924	and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease , and we don &apos;t know that either , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
5243	and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-hour version of it that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
3639	evolution has been an ongoing topic here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the perspective of an species on the subject .
2049	and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet a little crazy and also have a vision .
1571	these are about the same or the same grades , like a verbal , if very , very seemingly accurate , description of a landscape .
3071	right ? a syringe with an effective -- a few milliliters of an effective substance that you inject to a patient .
477	it may sound like genomic alchimie , but we can change software dna by changing things quite dramatically .
5972	but our system is not only shaped by questions that have to do with racial belonging , it &apos;s also degraded by poverty .
2752	and why ? because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
3163	because we asked these people about their reflection , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
1003	and this has now become a gigantic network of very good , yes , infrastructural centers that have been represented all over the world .
2319	looking at one of these summaries , i can then go into the subject of time magazine , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and see everybody together .
6521	and it shows others their mistakes , not just to make sure , but in a loving , supportive way , so that they all benefit .
784	let me tell you one very clear thing . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
276	and you &apos;re going to answer those questions regardless of whether that means doing all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and not get good grade in my class .
3426	and according to herodotus , they survived these famines for so 18 years by eating and playing the next day .
3075	and none of it has any really pharmaceutical property , and it &apos;s just our belief that we have a stronger impact within us .
6564	fish promotion meant countries that have already started hundreds of thousands of fish , the industrial fisheries of this fairly ugly ship is called mutiara 4 .
5970	one out of three men between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on currency , or in conditional punishment .
6735	for example , how a night light works , or why the doors of the elevator remain , or how an ipod responds to touch .
5881	we bring our kids and we get closer to the natural world and the magic , the fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of history .
692	and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen a performance like that in your life .
647	and then there were those moments -- i &apos;ll never forget the part -- she said there were moments in which she nearly missed it .
720	sophiolé ! it &apos;s for you , despite all this , just that you have the mere human love and the sense of being there .
397	you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
6114	in my assignment , i explained that misbehavior of the state council and the police and the security failures were considering .
250	in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
4505	so i said to my assistant , &quot; get me a list of all the experts on centrifuge and power plants from our client . &quot;
203	and this is something that , through the complexity that people use , grows , and their use for the user is getting bigger and bigger for the use .
2094	it was a beautiful fish , affordable , good consistency , rich , a best one on the menu .
5686	now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they started .
5145	and in that assembly , we &apos;ve left that assembly just as it used to be , except we &apos;ve added a little bit .
2865	chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the u.s. presidential election in 2000 .
3030	and to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or comes out of it , i &apos;m just going to put my wrist right here .
5781	so now i have a new generation of programs developed by combining programs that have come a little closer to the prescription than others .
2040	we &apos;ve now received over 10 million promoting projects , even to climb 10 megawatt-battery now to the german net .
2197	the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feed .
223	the reason for this is that freedom is good within itself , valuable , meaningful , an unjustifiable requirement for human beings .
4060	second-hand shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garden on the environment and also the money market on my purse .
1741	but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard , when people say , no one has the intention to build a wall .
3835	as chimpanzees are led by large , frightening candles , the bonobo-society is led by empowered females .
1666	people who &apos;ve never submitted have never felt instant with their own body , as it is to form a sound .
496	and it &apos;s just a nurture selection . we can selectively select , we can selectively select , production of chemicals , or fuel production , and so on .
4405	imagine a power plant , the clap , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom .
3986	next came the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like soccer truth , who spach about , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
1150	you also had to learn , so no small child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it sucessive and proportional , of course .
4479	stuxnet was like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- sniff it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
6024	in south africa , people have understood that the racup isn &apos;t overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
2388	together with ilm , we created the guys in liquid metal , and the success depended on how this effect would arrive .
993	these are the people who at least officially contributed on the website , d.i.y.bio-dot-org website .
4072	i &apos;ve bet that i would have everything else that i might want to wear , if i ever came to palm springs .
5750	you &apos;ve also seen tys &apos;s little example of evolution where he showed a little evolution in the convolution program , right in front of your eyes .
4670	every time i get on the way , and every time i open the medical sank , you &apos;ll see ban deodorant .
5547	there &apos;s now a project in the california justification project that the taxpayer has paid two billion dollars so far , and it doesn &apos;t work .
4255	so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go , like london &apos;s new mountain tops .
1894	because while you &apos;re busy trying to make it clear that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no previous man , the man is very happy .
4348	i feel like i &apos;ve been pushed underwater , and finally someone has moved down and raised my head so i can breathe . &quot;
1053	that means for a child who has lived to the achievement of the great year , most of his life with the receptions of stories .
943	and then it was about , yeah , o.k , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
4577	and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
5072	i loved going to this business , but at some point i was wondering , well , how come you never buy anything ?
3050	of course , it &apos;s being stuck there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my finger that &apos;s now there .
1368	i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one likes termites , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
6327	and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to solve the new challenges , and to do what we need to do .
2863	we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
5236	and then this community formed by people who shared this huge insider joke , and started talking about it and playing around with it .
2196	well , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
4506	and i called them , and i tapped their knowledge to compare their expertise with what we found in the code and in the data .
5300	we settled down in footscray , one of the working-class local suburbs , whose population is made of immigrant layers .
2831	i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on .
3066	a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . sorry .
1986	and the power-utility , which meant the power utility business on the island , meant we think that &apos;s great .
4381	i was the one who was beaten in the jungle green and blue every week until a teacher saved my life .
4605	so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , are they actually getting the film funded ?
1865	there was a scholar called johannes buridanus , and after that , the burian esel is named .
2952	if you go on this path , where belief and magic take evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
5086	of the people who stayed there when it was six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of brand collection .
4883	and the biggest question i get asked recently is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museum visitor ? &quot;
349	and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i had been disappointed compared to what i expected .
3202	and i &apos;ve probably gone from my memories to these three-week journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes , in the last four years .
6728	so to speed the blind or slow it down , just turn it on that button , and it makes the pulse faster or slower .
972	but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly in a frame where it becomes more available .
1512	very direct advertising , not for the company puma per se , but for now helping this company make these products successful .
6579	in fact , this mountain of debris is accumulated by fishermen every time they drive into areas where they &apos;ve never been fish .
1408	that is , the whole western civilizational story is that the city has always taken place , but the farmers have never given back .
5098	now it turns out that even if they disagree , when there were more opportunities for choice , even then it has negative consequences .
6604	they &apos;re going to confirm it , because the evidence , as they did in an earlier form , is not as they would like to demonstrate the evidence .
5097	in the places that offered almost 60 fonds , the scores now dropped to about the sixth percentage .
4015	but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story that i started telling you about the androgenreceptor defect .
6207	and that &apos;s because the food , electricity and transportation and communication costs have decreased a lot .
2796	and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends a lot of the time , and they all wanted to go to the past .
609	it &apos;s known by sokrates that he believed he had a dumb that shared his wisdom from farther away .
596	i say it straight , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here now -- it &apos;s probably the most likely that my biggest success is behind me .
3079	this is an 18-inch long hat needle . it &apos;s very , very sharp , and i &apos;m going to sterilize you a little bit first .
117	she came out one day on a brave band of maos , and for this transition , she had to go into a heavy job camp for seven years .
2069	it was like he was standing under the influence of an invisible arznei , a chemical response whose catalyst was my game .
5201	but web video has allowed us all , or all of our creative activities , to be terribly famous in a part of the world &apos;s culture .
446	here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called deinococus radiodurans , which has three million cycles of radiation .
4035	the united states has incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they are , without having to change to the state &apos;s will .
390	because the truth is , if you break the goldfish glass , everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
5101	none of those extreme decisions belong to the decisions that someone would recommend of people if we care about their future financial well-being .
5879	we all move to a world where the forces of technology can get closer and closer to the magic and technology .
5344	because belonging can lead so easily to the collapse of the horizon , it can mean that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
3346	up to this day , all the world of warfare players have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth .
3387	the reason is , when we play , we &apos;re actually happier at working hard than when we &apos;re relaxing or doing nothing .
4953	that means that each atom at the same time is in two different places , and at the same time , the whole piece of metal is in two different places .
3276	the recognition will be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries it &apos;s happening .
1914	but something like doofes like &apos; n solar pendulum , which somehow comes out of a hundred watts from the square meter , which was a toy .
6139	in turn , the courthouse was full of people who were angry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
124	now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we face in the ensuing millennia .
5866	in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect pictures of natural objects with the camera of the ipads .
6062	and then , woman carr then called me and said , &quot; bryan , woman parks comes to the city . we want to talk .
556	however , a shortcut of what &apos;s happened in my life and my career has given me to completely rethink my relationship to this work .
6108	i stayed up one night thinking , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have magic forces .
561	have you no fear that you keep writing your whole life and never again creating a book that anybody in the world cares about ? never again ?
2302	i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click what i &apos;m going to do here , which is to show me all the expenses in which lance armstrong is mentioned .
2962	everything we eat , every rice , every branch of petersily , every rose , was changed by the people .
135	he sprayed stores on the side of the fable knife , and when it was completely frozen , he amazed a dog .
3879	i want you to imagine two pairs in the middle of 1979 , exactly the same day , exactly the same moment , every baby -- okay .
6463	you can googlen it , but it &apos;s not infection of the rocket , but it &apos;s the upper respiratory pathway , and it causes the devastation of the breath .
213	how do you take a web search for pictures where you type out sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what the image is .
1011	this is a question that i &apos;m very moved as a designer , but also in the area of the research and usability and all things in the area of user experience .
6569	the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the wells , the trushing pile , were coral reefs .
2621	the rest 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture , and hopefully forest threat and cement will be clean up to that point .
22	and of those 6,000 languages today , as we sit here in monterey , right half of them are not being whispered into the ears of children .
3228	you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy his life lives and vice versa .
413	our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but still continued to increase , and our final point would now be on an exponential curve .
5933	then she said , &quot; the next thing i &apos;m saying is you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
4254	you can actually look at it from the bottom , which is the most important moments for olympics in 2012 and darwinds , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
2612	this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s now burned out , so it &apos;s called the real uranium .
2287	it &apos;s called pivot , and what i can do with pivot is i can filter after a certain cause of death , we say accidents .
1250	and as we see things in terms of what we &apos;re looking at , and how we sort of store ourselves against our environment , so that we can think of it accordingly .
1297	and this is on a higher grail of usage kindness than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the desktop .
962	and then their brainwaves have been measured , and depending on what they thought or what they thought they were , then different lights have happened in the room .
4540	so in a power plant , for example , when the great steam turbine becomes too fast , you have to open depositing valves within milliseconds .
6606	so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
3568	anthropools have found that we &apos;ve always required people from the members of our society to be useful and contribute .
1563	in the description of my talk , it says that as a interpreter , i am a translator , so in english worker , i understand .
6647	and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s more likely today that we &apos;re going to become victims of an online crime than a crime in the real world .
6424	and i lived through this rollercoaster because it came to the intensive care ward after stability , and i hoped it would recover .
3923	some people with xx chromosomes are developing something called ovotestis , which is covers of high-density tissues .
2500	but if we cut the price -- let &apos;s cut the price down -- let &apos;s cut the prize down -- let &apos;s hit a new barrier , and that barrier hangs on co2 .
2323	you see , we &apos;re surfing on the web the first time it &apos;s actually a web , not just from page to side , but much more abstract .
4011	it seems like our culture has a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we have to pull a line somewhere , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
5892	i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher matter , but the words of an engaged teacher are particularly meaningful .
4981	but you could go to a whole new place , a whole new housing block , given that the laws there would support this kind of structure and not prevent it .
2615	you know , there are many challenges , but there &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
2630	we have to track these breakthroughs with full gas , and we can measure that in corporate numbers , in fungi projects and regulation changes .
3483	we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
1386	and where you see , even in something like demeter , the most striking bio-agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own metabolism products to go back .
4613	do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective , because that &apos;s got a negative connotation -- but you know how that &apos;s going to evolve ?
3382	we believe that somebody spends time with us that the rules will maintain , that we have the same goal , and we remain there until the end of the game .
1875	only if you take another example , so if you immediately make a pile bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason , and it doesn &apos;t really need anything .
6618	so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give is cameron , so he turns &quot; avatar ii &quot; underwater .
6727	instead of having to code , wired or solve , littits littits allows them to program with simple , intuitive gestures .
4876	you can miss everything with remarks , send your friends , and start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
1289	now , the question , of course , is , what is the most intuitive manual of us , and now i &apos;ve already guessed it .
313	dan gilbert made a big point this morning by saying how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare to .
68	they call themselves the older brothers and they say that we are responsible for the younger brothers in the world &apos;s destruction .
1534	we can now do things that they do when they shrink , when they break , they can go into biological cycles .
4317	it starts with the sex sticks , then the words of vaccines , after the bush publishing , and finally , people actually do art .
6620	in the &apos; 80s , in the communist east germany , you had to , if you had a typewriter , register it at the government .
3530	but the truth is that we are changing . of course , we are shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotionally or even both .
5696	so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but what &apos;s interesting is , when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
6153	and most of all , i would like to say to those of you who are looking at this in the same way , just to say , don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give it up .
2622	so , in order to get that 80 percent , the developed states , including countries like china , have to completely reverse their electricity generation .
5761	my current activity is to design objects with such high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design them in a traditional sense .
3322	we feel overwhelmed . we feel angry . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
6332	and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long enough time , as that i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own false prestige to enable this .
6255	but then the technology of electrolyene was developed and made aluminum manufacturing so cheap that we use it with our throwaway mentality .
3735	why not have the skill of a ken jennings , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the watson machine ?
5937	i grew up in the country , in the old , rural southern , and i have a brother who is a year older and a year younger sister .
3497	of course , this was a great , old synonymous dictionary , and i just wondered that the input had to be quite old .
3149	i &apos;m not going to go into the details . she &apos;s no longer painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
6350	legendary -- like ted williams legendary -- the last major league baseball player who met over 400 times during a regular season .
5691	but these oil spills were not something like living in today , because each one of them was just a little , random recipe of chemicals .
303	through the non-participation , they spend up to 5,000 dollars a year on the employer who would have been happy to raise their contributions .
366	and so , when people make decisions , and even when the outcomes of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they combine themselves .
325	and the more ways we can choose , the more attractive properties of this choice are considered into the opperative cost .
4346	we also had to interrupt the parking lot , so we felt like we were part of the spraying scene .
2101	here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our chefs . how do we keep fish on our menu ?
2568	who can guarantee something that literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste you can imagine of nuclear and other things ?
916	this is from the united states a network , and this is actually more of a kind of forum of where you find yourself and discussing online .
549	i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limits is the value of things like the lhc .
917	they &apos;re a little bit more technical and a little bit of a business route , and then they get asked , yes , applied questions .
3900	but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
5864	the environmental crisis , a big problem over the last 10 years , is that kids are in their rooms , in their computers , without going out .
2538	so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s emitted per unit of energy .
5897	i got big in a family , a traditional african household dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
986	because if you just read about it , out of secondary literature , that &apos;s not the same thing as once you did it yourself or saw it .
139	the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 the complete control over an area larger than california and texas combined .
5189	even though the gear picks out , it doesn &apos;t tell me about my preferences in the interior enforcement , it still prepels me to choose .
6104	i go to the investigation prison , and i visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , who is supposed to be in court as adults .
4028	what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to thinking about questions about democracy .
6484	oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about your own mistakes .
3845	i &apos;m not saying that this is the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the life of the bonobos is more than the cama sutra .
5047	so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between several cities that compete in competition for new residents ?
1969	it &apos;s going to be , anyway , an energy carrier , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , or sh , that &apos;s going to be then .
5491	and if you &apos;re on vacation , and someone collapses , whether it &apos;s your own relationship or anyone else , you can find an aed like that .
4277	the last images i &apos;d like to show you are an iceberg that i photographed in kekertsuatsiak in greenland .
181	you can see that when we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and have this experience of several times the resolution .
3031	in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time anything moving , but as i squeeze here , nothing can go into my sleeve or get out .
2368	since , in the 40 years that have been out there , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , 500 hours of it in submersibles .
3488	when i look into the next decade , i &apos;m sure in two things : that we can create any imaginable future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
5545	we were told later that if it went over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
3796	when i found the main man , he had just a very serious conversation with the house owner , who surely had one of the worst days of their life .
1465	if i invite you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with open water taste and a glass of water .
4957	so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that piece of metal can be in two different places , why not you ?
107	or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i study a lot recently , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
6278	and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , coca-cola will apply this technology globally in 206 countries around the planet .
6222	first , how smoothly she traces -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and high school juncture .
3708	i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that is not just natural , but led and decided from us as an individual in the decisions that we make .
5235	what &apos;s important is that a single person or group of tastemakers entered a standpoint , shared a large audience and started accelerating the process .
4616	i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth speaking to some really well-known brands .
4304	and he said , &quot; no , just if you &apos;re listening to the higher social class and you have remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
1268	because usually we &apos;re through this new kind of usability , which is the natural user ínterfaces , for example , five times faster on our goal .
5113	when proctor and gamble decreased the different head and shoulder species of 26 to 15 , they experienced about 10 percent increase in sales .
4918	because if all things are made out of particles , and all these particles are following the rules of quantum mechanics , shouldn &apos;t it just be the rules of quantum mechanics ?
1826	and if you have this premise , you can understand the logic that we &apos;re having with this happiness to improve our world through a lie .
1920	and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very moved because many , many beautiful expressions were there that i &apos;ve also lived through .
4722	i needed somebody who could penetrate into my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call &quot; brand personality . &quot;
2213	i said , &quot; miguel , is there a well-meaning avian avian population not the last thing you want to stop on a fish ? &quot;
4477	this attracted our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our surroundings with stuxnet , and we studied this constructive .
513	you saw it with the flu this year , we &apos;re always on the back a year , and we have a dollar too little if it comes to the right vaccine .
1458	but a lip pen , even in this illumination , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but really effective , right ?
4393	we found one for them , we took them , and we took care of them , and we took care of them , and we gave eight on their family because it was necessary .
2495	in fact , if you could only reduce the price from one thing , to reduce poverty reduction , energy in far the most effective .
3298	why ? this picture really describes why i think games are so essential for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
3051	and when i close my hand , the same thing happens is , as i turn back , i get borrowed through this movement that the finger moves back .
4073	and since you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking around here at ted in her underwear -- that means i found some things .
541	now , all of this is even more impressive when you think that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and shifted around 30 inches .
3791	if i don &apos;t fight poverty , i fired a fireman with a volunteer shaped fire .
244	my favorite one is the one in the middle -- mp3 playwinner , nash hairs trimmer and crème brée fackel .
5102	well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences in humans that offer more and more choice .
2036	and i just expect that in the next 30 years , we &apos;ll have the same capacity for electrochemical stores all over the world .
5030	everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the permits .
4983	later , i found out that , around the same time , jafour and octavio , they were thinking about the challenge of a reform in honduras .
764	the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fuels .
5732	because at this point , an individual -- learning happened within the time of a single organism &apos;s lifetime , rather than through this evolutionary time period .
3777	his completely non-invasive sensors in the crutches , the signals send back to our onboard-computer that &apos;s attached to your back here .
4779	because they went around the middle man , they went around the agencies , and said that the agencies might not really have their interest in it .
1665	it &apos;s necessary to have its own experience and idea of music , and then to have it through another way , about an instrument , to make it sound .
2732	and of course , there are teams who have a lot more ta-da imagery , and the best ones are fresh kids &apos;s graduates .
4992	we give new technologies great attention , but for the progress it needs to be technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually the laws that keep us back .
3784	adaptive technologies have allowed me since then to learn how to ski again , climb and even bike with their hands .
1801	and if you think about that , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you &apos;d like to put bridges somewhere and be pleased when the fire comes up afterwards .
2052	when steve lopez , the columnist of the los angeles times , one day went through the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
531	i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest jug , or this , when someone visited the google side and found the front page .
4500	and then we looked for timer and data structures and tried to relate them to the real world -- potential goals in the real world .
476	all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we transferred .
580	but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not received the call of alcohol depressed people over the centuries .
5619	well , for those of us who &apos;ve given government , it &apos;s time for us to think about the world we want to leave our children behind .
2871	and i can say that for the reason that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen it before , and hopefully never will see again .
1765	and you also know how much hostility out of this real place , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , out of that real place .
3513	a man who opened doors for me was my pediatrician at a.i. dupont institute in wilmington in delaware .
6665	now , a certificate , if you have a website with https , with ssl-encrypted services , for example , gmail .
5183	what they find is that the people that go from the many to the low possible polls over and over and over again , choose the standard choice .
2389	and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we already played a little bit more money with the film .
4979	but you know what they were going to be comfortable with , in these apartments and their surroundings , they &apos;re going to have laws to avoid being compromised and deflecting from degradation .
823	they can be moved by the hand , they can perceive each other , they can grab their movements , and they have a screen and a radio receiver .
30	now there are some of us who have sort of forgotten that , when i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really mean different possibilities of being .
4005	maria whereas , in all states , can &apos;t perceive the same law that heinrich in all states has , and marry is the right to marry .
4257	and a kind of digital light bulb at night -- but most importantly , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
5182	if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choice in the decision , that means you &apos;re being overwhelmed , the hottest one , i &apos;m losing it .
5992	we believe that because we &apos;ve taught that the real question is , did a human being deserve to die for a crime of him ?
5756	the process feeds itself and becomes , i think , auto-catalytics is the word for it -- when something increases its change velocity .
1002	and hackerspaces , which is the computer hackers &apos; space , because the c-base in berlin was the first , ninety-1000-foot ninth .
2417	anyway , from the part that had to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
1994	it &apos;s got a megawatt power , and it can do that for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of got out of simulation technology .
3154	patient b clearly has suffered more . his gut reflection was longer , and every minute of pain the patient a had patient b , and more .
4055	but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to do a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
5921	she took me out and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you &apos;re not going to say it . &quot;
926	and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s usually quite young people , but the only thing that really brings you all together is this fascination in technology .
3137	there is an emerging self that lives in the present , and the present , is capable of experiencing the past , but basically only has the present .
2073	and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he also connected it to a very close personal relationship .
5745	we go through the same stages that have been through multi-cellular organisms -- that represent the abstraction of our methods of capturing data , unemployment .
6711	eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore how you could put the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
3691	i think we &apos;d all understand the mood that woody allen expressed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality from my work .
435	triplets of these letters -- these letters code about 20 amino acids ; and here &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
5633	this could be to sniff up a hydrant , sniff uncrypt , flip a trash with a thylacine .
6512	and then their pupils are expanding , they &apos;ve poured in front of their head , and then they look down and they look hard , and they start telling their stories .
3676	in fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our body occurs in evolution at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
4770	over the course of the movie , we had over 500 companies that were up and down companies and they said , &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
3932	and when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually visualizes something very different to us , that actually confuses us in terms of these categories .
1904	she &apos;s one of the senior seniors here from this great conference , and she asked me if i &apos;m going to give a talk here and give my idea a prize .
3826	a place where women take the prescription , say , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious matter .
5029	this is a picture of a big , new city center built in south korea -- big than the city center of bostons .
801	the red thread that all connects them is our dependence on carbon products like dirty coal and foreign oil .
5493	these could be coastal services , or technicians , for example , just to make sure that the signed aed is still in his place .
3722	it &apos;s not going to take longer , until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be available more and more for everybody .
1451	so imagine if , for example , your wife is sad when you &apos;ve been annoyed with her , and you come in at age 15 .
3095	they say , &quot; okay , he &apos;s probably not so stupid and she &apos;s going through the skin just to stop us for a few minutes . &quot;
5190	i &apos;m also excited about the great product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be interested in this .
460	if we were to print it on a scale of 10 and without waste , it would encompass 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
4920	so i would feel very clearly better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
967	and the machines that make these things are pretty expensive to buy commercial ones , the cheapest ones go off at four thousand euros .
3565	there &apos;s the usual one . the typical one . but not the normal one , and would you really want to know this poor , gray person if they really existed ?
734	compared to the entire amount of climate change in the atmosphere , this amount could double if we cross this critical dot .
4593	what i want to do is make a film around product placement , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
5451	it &apos;s not particularly scientifically -- it puts a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how does it go ?
2922	now , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody &apos;s been on a plane this morning in lagos , and they &apos;re just flying to los angeles , right now he &apos;s over ohio .
5685	so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.5 billion years , and the earth was a big , sterile stone clump with lots of these floating chemicals .
5914	i remember i had to have been eight or nine that i woke up one day and went to the living room , all my cousins were lying around .
6030	it got very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever again speak to the systematic killing of people .
601	after some time of reflection , i seem to be able to continue writing , i need to design a kind of protective psychological construct .
4387	about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of the night from this teacher , woman posting , saying , &quot; i have to see you .
5688	some of these oil droplet contained a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and so on .
166	we &apos;ve designed a misad with very high-resolution , which is much higher than a normal ad , and we &apos;ve added additional content .
2002	so we &apos;re not a battery manufacturer , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s just between the battery and the subject of the web and everything in between .
1622	but i was very fortunate to meet him , very early , at age three , 10 , and so i was already in my school , on his classes .
4990	through improvement , testing and investigating consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city to essentially reduce elements .
1426	and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over 100 to 50 in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been sabotted .
224	when people have freedom , each of us , for themselves , is about doing the things that maximize our public good , and no one has to choose for us .
6081	then , woman carr sat down in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
516	we are removed from light years from people . our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to possibly do that . thank you very much .
5074	they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were locked in boxes that came from thousands of years of old olive trees .
2143	no , i actually loved this fish , because , you know , i swear to god , who chopped fish after this conversation after chicken .
1006	now it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and you put enough energy in there , then you get far .
4081	this whole outfit , including the jacket , it cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i &apos;ve worn all this week .
1579	so it &apos;s not enough to learn to read just grades and to press the keyboards on the piano or the right place on a violin string .
1034	and this ability to virtual reality the virtual reality that people in the pre-industrial times also needed a lot more , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
3004	it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
300	because it &apos;s 50 investment funds that are going to be selected , it &apos;s so hard to decide which one to choose that they &apos;re going to put it in the morning .
3850	play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about creating diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
5391	i combined it with my former love of drawing , but it was a little different because , using the camera , the process was a lot more in the planning process .
1004	and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to spread a little bit like that , and then we &apos;re also pretty well connected , so that we &apos;re going to be able to get more people involved .
2879	we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a government leader who gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
1585	after you &apos;ve ever chosen a piece to play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re first exploring about the emergence of the composition .
1075	and that &apos;s exactly what happened is that we have overlaid responsibility for our memories and our own production of our individual memories on external media .
5600	and you could have been able to connect them to federal services if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to federal services .
918	and based on these networks that have made the whole popular , there has been a scene that i want to make for a moment .
5401	because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really catch , but i always want to make it look like you could have done that in a photograph .
613	that &apos;s brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological structure that protects you from the follow of your work .
3726	the same technology that the human insulin produces in bacteria can make viruses that can &apos;t only protect itself , but can also serve for immunity against other viruses .
2220	okay , let &apos;s think about that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success in their predators &apos; health .
3653	this is not like humaninsulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically discriminable from what comes out of the pancreas .
3380	there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we like after playing with them , even though they defeated us badly .
5623	the good news is that technology makes it possible to interpret the function of government fundamentally , in a way that can actually achieve by empowering society .
3715	what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or eliminate cancer risk or stroke seizures ?
4017	he says we should not ask people to &quot; their skin color , but by the characteristics of their character , &quot; and he goes beyond anatomy .
3581	the doctor for pratal diagnosis of my mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
904	that &apos;s kind of sad for the hackerscene , because that &apos;s not what they actually started doing , and what &apos;s really behind it .
3256	now , when we telephone a couple of weeks ago , they were mentioning to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup question .
1138	now you &apos;re going to ask , why do all of the stages begin to engage with such natural , archaic forms of communication , interaction , etc . , etc .
882	so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new human-computer interfaces that fit better in how our brains and bodies work .
3660	it &apos;s a really easy way for bacteria , with occasional interruptions of the unintended , jeodch forced to do it .
4345	and he drew again for the first time , in both his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense that was in the parking lot .
965	so it &apos;s about copying genes , metabolizing genes , d.n.a , gathering fragments so you can make them visible .
324	oppersistence costs down the happiness that we get from our selection , even though what we chose is fantastic .
5276	think of him in the march of the communist in saigon , the way he needs to admit that his life was a single waste .
905	and in fact , the software hackers , in the &apos; 70s , they started out in the &apos; 80s with computer tinkering , and this is what the internet came from .
5007	so i tried to convince the hondurans if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square miles .
2877	the data came from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no at all .
1997	over here , we simulate the whole transmission system , the miles of physics of the cable , to sort of map the vibrational behavior on the web .
988	and if you want to be an informed citizen to be able to make meaningful decisions in society and be able to talk to you , you need to have access to knowledge and technology .
3919	and as a consequence , his genitaly was male , his brain was exposed to the typical male part of the hormone spectrum .
661	but then he got older and quiet . he told me that one day he was driving on a highway in los angeles , and that &apos;s where everything changed for him .
2303	now , if i just want to get a larger view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at it all on bicycle bicycles ? &quot;
3409	they can tap into more powerful social bonds than they do in real life . they get more feedback and reward rewards in games than in real life .
1650	and then , if all your fingers are going to be done in time and in the right way that it &apos;s in the notes , then they come out sounds that sound like music together .
4602	but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a subtle sponsor , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;ll sell every possible category in the movie .
5796	i sat in a 747 together with marvin minsky , and he pulled out a map and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
5129	and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i ask them to clap when they &apos;re ready to take gary &apos;s offering .
3303	you probably see this sense of urgency , some kind of fear , but also external concentration , very deep into solving a really difficult problem .
1432	and by the way , if you want to do what they want to do , they write up , in germany , the best way is enabled by all the educational facilities in france .
4987	in the next planned elections , pepe lobo won in a turnaround , whose program promised both innovations and light .
5820	back then , when the great indian war , arjuna , he took an arc , shot in the ground and water stepped in .
664	so he starts to climb this old adhesive into him , like , how do i lose this thing and be pursued by this song all the time .
938	and this is biocurious , who &apos;s just mentioned hackerspace , this one , sort of , like a volkshochschool , basically for molecular biology .
1804	now , this proof of that he knew in the inside of the bub that he was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that loud .
2923	and he ends up in a couple of hours , and he tends to have a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fabulous ted dinner tonight .
3797	it was in the middle of the night , and it was in the slaughter train and barefoot under a screen out in the floating rain as your house stood in flames .
2328	that &apos;s why it &apos;s important , because you can only look through websites in this way , look at the entire internet course in the same way .
6695	the first concrete blocks were made in 1868 , and they came up with a very simple idea : module from cement with a distinct measurement that fit .
3918	he &apos;s got xx chromosome , and in the womb , his next kidneys were so active that they basically created a male hormone environment .
281	so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions about jobs , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
659	for me , the best living example of how to create this is the musician tom waits , and i was able to interview him for a magazine a few years ago .
5907	one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
5420	so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
1494	and it &apos;s a lust when you see them in italy , like the people in the high bow dropped out of the car like that , you know , coke can get out of the car .
4581	i sent some facebook messages , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to get the name rights on my tedtalk 2011 .
5036	a country has already offered it to provide its supreme court as a courthouse for the absence of the legal system there .
2844	and i was amazed to reject , resistant to what is the most effective thing in human health care history at the end .
3868	but they also have a secret to our future , a future in which we need to adapt to more and more challenges , through major creativity and print reinforcing cooperation .
4667	and then my friends , they say , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant hollywood films ? &quot;
4791	and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every advertising agency that we talked to would have recommended their clients to have their fingers on it .
3965	what they depend on was an anatomic concept , and they put it through another that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us was achieved .
6267	do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager-spacecraft in 1990 , when it passed by saturn , back to earth ?
2461	because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who &apos;ve been working for years uninterrupted , and sometimes we &apos;ve been back to sea for two to three months .
3041	i say that i embrace my wrist to make sure there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve or out of my sleeve , and that &apos;s a lie .
1887	and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything , and most importantly , if you want to make people happy , practice that courage to lie .
3550	and maybe we &apos;ll be able to see the odds as something that is natural , coherent and useful , and we don &apos;t feel that bothered by their presence anymore .
5885	i spend most of my time living with the socially weakest in the social settlements , and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
4553	and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to get the user data on a usb key , as we saw it at stuxnet .
6192	and because there &apos;s nothing more important to us than our survival , the first place for all this information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
2392	the basic idea of this company was to skip the phase of analogy processes with optical printing , etc . , and start right with digital production .
4777	the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got the most feedback or where i had the biggest success are , those are where i interacted with things directly .
3189	and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a memory self from a living self , and time has very little influence on this story .
4940	and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal stopped as quantum mechanical , we had to kick all the charges out .
119	and in the end , we &apos;re really in front of a choice . do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotonies or in a polychromatic world of diversity ?
3881	now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time thinking about stuff because , if you think about it all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
4104	it was proven to me over and over that week when people came up to me just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
3540	you have to separate two things : to be the medical fact , to be amputated , and to the other , the social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
335	so , i went to buy new jeans after many years of old wear , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
47	so in order to make this conversation a sense , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in the voodoo and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
707	but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pure if you didn &apos;t believe from the very beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from you .
402	we have digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the human genome , the change from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
1396	we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest , not to be there , right ?
3971	they nivellized the playground , and they decided that anatomically , they counted the similarities , not the differences , and that was very radical .
1153	depending on how i throw and when i throw , it &apos;s , of course , a very different narrative , as if there &apos;s a kind of a living thing .
5324	in the other hand , i was involved in unsafe life that wore the tragic scars of violence , the drug abuse and the isolation .
1919	the location of terrorism , but that was called the &quot; washing electronics &quot; and made wind and sunenergy , and that &apos;s where i started in the mid-80s .
4268	some people refuse to give up and grab up to the bitter end , while others stop it and collapse in a case of dramatic passion .
1879	there &apos;s a scholar that &apos;s called wolf singer , and you sometimes say , &quot; wolf singer , &quot; there &apos;s no willingness .
3990	of course , the problem is , as we start looking at all the similarities , we need to start asking , why do we stop certain divisions ?
3727	whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental trial in gang with vaccine versus influenza that &apos;s been built in the cells of a tobacco plant .
5126	and gary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience an all-inclusive vacation on the most beautiful street in the world .
5301	unlike in the old-class suburbs , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no sophisticated thinking in footscray .
1144	so if we look at the evolution of our society , in short , we &apos;re moving now from the third into the fourth generation of social or social form .
6447	and then on a weekly day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke out , and i said , maybe i could feel better again .
3478	we have a comic in it . we have &quot; level high &quot; for regional understanding , knowledge connectivity , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
5575	and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock skin ? &quot;
5794	i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to do the job because you come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
3970	the founding fathers showed this idea back and built it through a new anatomic concept , and this concept said that all people were created equal .
1167	that is , from the local village , actually , a global village , with the same principles , enabled , intuitively , but also the total transparency .
4962	when we warmed it up , we turned on the lights and we looked in the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in one piece .
4485	so , that really caught my interest , and we started working with this , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
33	they have a peculiar language and a marriage manuscript called the linguistic exogamy : you have to marry someone who speaks a different language .
6282	just consider that a massai warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan did 25 years ago .
3684	i came to the realization that as a doctor , i worked on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevitably contradictory , just different .
3611	they were just told that they were the one-student , and the students are sufficient with the grade , and they also taught them something , and they treated them .
79	now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
5468	and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , send it to their doctor and share it with other people , for something more than 100 dollars .
4950	so the first case : all the trillions of atoms that are made of metal are still there , and at the same time the same atoms are moving up and down .
115	he was muggled into prison at the age of two , to hide under her rock cube , because she could not live without him .
1060	and as you can see , this is a very rare area , and you had to sort of navigate there , from the island to the island , to get food .
285	and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to affect your experience of the football game of your child very differently than it would have been .
4117	some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula one race , you would take your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
985	because , as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an incredibly important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also no way to really get good at it .
5255	in a world where every minute two days of video is uploaded , it can only create really unique and unexpected videos like the mentioned video .
3721	today , you can complete a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a price of about 20,000 dollars and into the space of about a week .
2948	and you know what ? when i say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; what cares you ? let people do what they want .
6522	and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s the way , then people make mistakes from time to time .
1792	i told my wife , every time a human being in a moral rights uses the word because we should try to replace it by the word .
6238	and every year , we ask the students to create business , products and services that , within a decade , can positively affect the lives of billions of people .
5143	and it turns out that if you make it feel concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
3538	so , not only are we responsible for preserving the people we love in favor of sleeps , but preaching them for getting along with it well .
6307	how about giving the oppressed , wherever you are , a voice to pay attention , and creating change for the very first time ?
1802	no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge to eliminate the dangers that others can only do when they &apos;re on fire .
4056	i love every opportunity to find another colorful , crazy outfit , and to photograph and blog in the last time .
2014	and our european interconnectedness network is basically just made out of louder rotating mass of big power plants , where the wave is all around europe all the time .
4103	and finally , saturday : building a unique , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
3135	they didn &apos;t count , because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had received .
894	i think that molecular biology is generally speaking , so in general , biotechnology , everything you count to it , synthetic biology and so on .
6149	i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far wiping out , but that it will increase the justice .
638	a process that , as everyone knows , has ever tried to do anything -- in other words , everybody here -- has not always been rational .
2359	and something interesting happened , because what fascinated me about jacques cousteau shows was the thought of a totally unknown world here on earth itself .
5742	so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sounds , a sequence of sounds , and we make something very complicated in the minds of others .
1604	it &apos;s a very happy concert over and over again , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been working on in advance for as long as i &apos;ve seen new ones .
5635	but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who are paying taxes and taxes .
6477	and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst errors happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues claim is complete nonsense .
1886	but the logic of deception allows us to pretend that the first sentence of precaution is wrong , of course , as you would have to embrace the opposite without proof .
5068	when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive grocery store , at least at the time he was really exclusive .
5023	in a country that has just been behind a major crisis , where congress was elected for this comprehension change with 124 to a voice .
3651	it seems that we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually for the most part , the basic mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
4759	well , there are interrogated brands and eight brands , these things that come and go , but an interrogated , eight brand is a pretty strong thing .
4327	many of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid to do that , and that we would come back and all the pictures on the walls would be graffitis .
2027	yeah , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , growing the coal plants , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or gastorbines , because that &apos;s not the case .
4784	according to burral , the premiere was in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this film .
2834	but this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me awake at night . we &apos;ve never used scientific advance as it is now , never .
398	in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code to a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
2663	so what was a problem for these reactors is , what we do in our fills , and that &apos;s where the waste volume is dramatically reduced as we do this process .
6671	well , in egypt , the insurgency in april 2011 was the headquarters of the egyptian police headquarters , and they found a lot of actors .
2658	but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- buried it without all the complex qualities .
616	if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t miss it all for you . everybody knew you had this disembodied genius that helped you .
3437	but the latest dna evidence shows that the etrussians , who later formed the roman empire , show the same dna as the old lyrics .
520	his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the universe began -- and that up to 600 million times within a second .
3740	we &apos;re going to have a process that usually requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it for a thousand years -- and maybe even for the next 100 years .
5434	i personally find that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise with the ideas in your head .
5998	in nine people we &apos;ve executed , one of the things we &apos;ve found for innocent is that has been unlocked and released from the death cell .
1214	that means we &apos;re just projecting our vision before we see it , we put it in our backyard apparatus to say , okay .
5582	one day -- this is an actual report -- it came in , &quot; thylacines in my trash clay . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
5797	it says , &quot; this airplane consists of hundreds of thousands of little pieces that are working together to make your flight safer . &quot; does that make you more confident ? &quot;
6242	when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
5733	so , for example , an organism could learn to eat a particular fruit , because it tasted bad and made it sick the last time it eaten it .
4395	and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult , met me , she turned into a box full of ash and was placed in my hands .
6143	finally , this older black man came in with a very troubled face outlet in the courthouse room and sat behind me , almost to the defense bank .
2730	there are a number of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst of them are fresh bwl graduates .
980	a juicer , if you make the full power of water , has enough pressures , so i think , 40 to six pounds worth of pressure .
345	the reason i felt worse was with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good couple of jeans were doing , went up .
1012	it &apos;s about how you encounter people in interactive media , so that they can use these interactive media and create a enabling experience .
2032	and many discussions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years were similar to the discussion that i &apos;ve had in the last 30 years about photovoltaics .
6290	imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
5011	the head of congress came onstage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
547	we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we expect to be able to collect first data in june or july , and continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
4341	and after a year of planning , two weeks of programming , nuclear parties and searched , tony recorded after seven years .
2467	so i got back with a small team on unknown terrain , and we turned &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that had not been there before .
948	and we then have that one that &apos;s not compound , but that &apos;s , you know , i think it &apos;s pretty well done , that people are quite convinced of that .
6747	we want to encourage the world of the creator , the inventor , the empowering , because this world we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
3279	how to increase happiness is very different depends on how you think and think about whether you think about the memory of yourself , or whether you think about the life itself .
4903	i mean , it can sound strange to think that one thing at the same time is in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it .
3014	we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but when we get into the time machine and we &apos;ll be happy to go into the future .
5075	so i decided to go to the filialline one day , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model work that you really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
2789	and sometimes a small prototype of that experience is everything it takes to take us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; to a ta-da moment .
2396	but the brushing pole was quite beautiful , and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this before .
1623	i used to be 17 when i entered one of his courses on one of his classes , and i played the last of the four balloops of chopin , one day &apos;s work .
6027	it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you speak like this . &quot;
1523	and of course , if we succeed , it will help us for obesity , for nike , for henry and mauritz and all the textile industries .
6398	maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was doing that , and so i would be able to take care of my patients without having to contact him .
2354	and since there wasn &apos;t video games or this kind of over-saturation with computer-generated movies or all of the imagery in the media landscape , i had to make the pictures in my head .
4897	and so i see myself as one of the people , along with the most other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good percentage of logic to put together the complex ideas .
441	in every step , we made these pieces in the circuit so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
2350	jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating sensations that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonder we never could have imagined before .
4016	if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; a kind of a solution .
3518	and imagine i actually negotiated as a five-year-old child with dr. p. and tried to stop these practices , naturally without success .
2671	bg : now we need one of these scalable , power generating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent , and then 20 years to spend .
5257	i got a ticket because i didn &apos;t get on the bike , but often there are challenges that don &apos;t have you on the bike all the time .
2104	90 percent of the big fish , the one we love , the tuna , the hot butte , the salmon , heavy fish , they &apos;re collapsed .
2290	we can take a step further and then rearrange the data and see that cycles and cancer are the common suspects , but not for everybody .
5239	unlike the 20th century unfair conversation , the participation in the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new .
4326	my wife , my children and i moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theoretics and archists have taken over our house .
2703	bg : well , the actual spending on the research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
6205	in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has tripled to inflation of the average average average average income of the world &apos;s population .
2398	i sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . &quot; it became a love film of epic , a passionate movie .
1988	and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we could sort of map the electrical ratio of the island one to three very precisely .
1269	you have to imagine that if you do something of the classic sofware , you need five hours , and with this new type of natural software , it &apos;s just an hour .
653	i &apos;m a beetle . to be able to work , i have to stand up every day at the same time and sweat , tear down and really uncomfortable .
3423	so they came out , according to herodotus , the cube game and agreed with a national strategy , and on one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
2044	so far , in discussions , these insulanders , they do have autark , they have their own little web , which has nothing to do with our interconnectedness .
2623	the other note is whether we use the zero-emission of technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
3866	and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected link that we &apos;re creating is really the essence of creativity .
5465	but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs and get them to play together some kind of game to better control their health .
1573	that means the interpret must translate these ingenious noises into another , namely audible , concrete , non-verbal music language .
1266	this is intuitive usage , not only since apple has been an elementary economic factor , elementary success factor , if i just wanted to use technology to people .
3937	many journalists called me the question , &quot; what test are you going to do that tells us if caster semenya is female or male ? &quot;
2974	now , what i hear is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormonoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
1168	as you know in the village at that time , who &apos;s got what with whom and when , this is happening today through this expansion of our self through these mobile devices at a global level .
3233	when i tell you that somebody has introduced his life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with their own alive .
5436	and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i needed several months to plan it , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
2129	now , i telephonized with a couple of people in the company , and nobody could give me a corrective answer , until i finally telephed with the senior biologists .
2060	we got to talk about music . and a couple of days later , i got an email that said nathaniel was interested in learning in me .
354	the reason that it used to be better than anything worse than anything worse than anything worse was to make it possible for people to have experiences that were a great surprise .
4769	are they reliable , stable , family , sure , born , holy , considerable , like the dalai lama or yoda ?
6033	how it would feel to live in a world where the german state made people , especially if there were a lot of jews beneath it .
3894	and very often , i &apos;ve been working with intersexual people whose gender is atypal -- people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
4493	and if you &apos;ve already heard that the student is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science for it .
2355	we all had to do that at the time . when we read a book as children , we took the description of the author , and we projected it on the screen in our heads .
479	and i &apos;ve argued that we might be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new species education based on this digital design .
1033	and that &apos;s where we have trouble at the media campus , for example , demonstrating virtual reality in our v.r. lab , where we can actually do it all the time .
6448	and i talked to myself that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never made any mistake that the voice could get worse .
3352	but it also turns out , because it turns out , by using all this time , we &apos;re actually changing what we &apos;re capable of as human beings .
1715	i can now bring the claims that the stream has had on the modern wing to sound what a baroque cembalo can &apos;t do .
1566	already from german to english , it can require more knowledge , even though you &apos;re about poetry or even poetry .
81	this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the strongest psychoactive preparate from the repertoire of the cockroach .
683	i talked out loud , you know , stuff , you and i both know , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not entirely my fault , right ?
6188	so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
2176	they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all they see are fluidized edges and these density , lush march .
1755	at this point and when you laugh , you can see how important this gap is and how much time you need to know what artists can tell us very well .
3948	one of the areas in which we see this for the beipiel , in our modern culture , in the united states today , are the struggle over the beginning and the end of life .
5711	but then another very interesting step happened where things got completely different , and that is that these cells started to communicate and share information , so that communities came from cells .
3245	and what happens is , when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
490	we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
6351	let &apos;s go back to my medical world , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely i &apos;ve talked to you about this .
839	basically , you get every round on every siftable letter at random , and as you try to form words , they get tested about a dictionary .
5565	and because the government ultimately exhauls its power out of us -- remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , is going to affect how this change is going to happen .
6323	ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals today to make us the big challenges of our planet .
3230	what that means is that if you hit someone , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
5549	so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s rarely expanded , is a kind of kiss before the bug on the institution of the government .
637	because it makes just as much sense as everything else i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the utterly inspiring capability of the creative process .
519	so , it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there then , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever approached -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
3304	if you also play , you can see some nuances here , the eyes that are zoomed up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
2107	a lot of the arguments about it . fisheries are polluting the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
6291	if this device is sequencing a rna- or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it &apos;s calling the ministry of health and prevents a pandemic from its outbreak .
5770	now , please perform all of these random elected instructions , run all the programs , and eventually choose the ones that i gave them the next . &quot;
4328	but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed , we went to the boardroom in venice , and my kids have been raised , my dog , and we created this .
3110	but i think in this framework here , and with the intent to make something real out of an illusion , i &apos;m just going to let the needle in there and go from the stage .
3418	and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
5087	now , when you calculate it , people bought six times more of a glass of marking , who they had six choices than they had 24 choices .
3141	these are two very different units , the hereditary self and the memory itself , and the two of them are part of the distinction in terms of happiness .
475	and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell .
1370	and because they work much tougher physically than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they speak in their weight , in energy consumption , a little three-billion people .
5000	but it was a fairly abstract debate , in one place when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
2823	and from my point of view , the scientific method is to try things out , see if it works , change if it doesn &apos;t , one of the great achievements in humanity .
2042	so , from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that defense to yes , to the notion of 100 percent renewable .
4243	i think that the remarkable thing about the last few years , the last decade , is that we &apos;ve moved from a physical to a digital world .
6400	so i sent her home , i missed a quiet voice in me trying to say , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
3915	so gender is really complicated ; intergender isn &apos;t just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a way , you can be spread across the bandwidth .
143	and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to recognize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
2462	and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the level of view that you have in front of each other , because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else .
32	this is a people who are not cognitively different from the colors of blue and green , because the sky scene is the forest that people depend on .
2349	and my love of science fiction seemed to resist in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon , and we explored the deep sea .
153	we see a lot of , a lot of gigabytes on digital photographs here , that you can bring in seamlessly and continuously , turn turn , rearrange in any way .
95	this tribe , the cofan , has 17 variants of ayahuasca , that all of you see at great distances in the forest that appear for our eyes as a species .
4638	and i was confused because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to present your product to as many people as possible , could see it as many people as possible .
6509	so if you take the system the way i &apos;ve been taught , and you have all the disembodied health workers , then at the end of the day , there &apos;s no one left .
2451	i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you can , i &apos;m sure , have to have a director , be a leader like a ship captain or something .
1985	that our system has a price increase in it is that we &apos;re still going to make 20 percent with this oil , and we &apos;re not going to have a price increase in the other things .
1325	we have only phosphorus for two years , and now , through phosphorus mining , the world &apos;s phosphorus mining is being brought to the environment much more uranium than in all atomic plants .
5624	and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , it &apos;s just to build systems .
5982	we predict that in 10 years , the death rates of civil honor rights will be as high as before the legislation of the election law passed .
3706	and as far as the isolation goes when we colonize away as a species , there will be isolation and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in a natural way .
2413	you get into this capsule , you float down into this dark , hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope for rescue , if you don &apos;t make it back yourself .
1856	it depends on a third sentence that has nothing whatsoever to do with the first two sentences , and it does as if the opposite of the first sentence has already proven and presented .
3124	the second trap is a change in experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happiness in his life and being happy about his life , or happy with his life .
1701	the food that &apos;s been cooked by a cookin or a chef has to be eaten , not just to eat , or to exchange recipes .
3810	a few weeks later , the fire guard got a letter from the home owner , where they thanked for the keyboard on the rescue of their house .
2394	but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that in the creature- and our industrial design -- which we actually started the company -- we started to emerge too slowly .
3273	if people were to take this finance seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on its head , everything we think , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on .
215	then the scale of the semanic cross connection and the abundance that comes out of it is really huge . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
2369	and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the shallow oceans , is so rich in fascinating life as we really can &apos;t possibly imagine .
5052	i &apos;ve recently made a poll about 25,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , which are scared to make a typical american one day is 70 .
923	they &apos;re in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , also electronics , and they &apos;re combining it in a pretty straightforward way .
2904	now , that &apos;s good , except for paul to walk around and talk about vaccines and say how valuable they are , and that people should just stop jamming .
956	and then we screwed down a d.v.d brenner , and we pulled the fire out the laser and then tried to focus on that camera there .
2644	they should have discussed this innovation strategy , and they would be smiled by the ridiculous funds that are going to be spent on these innovative approaches .
1960	and if you want to go about 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , which is energy per year , not the power at the moment , you have to turn off this one .
5774	of course , the chance at random in elected instructions is very small that , by chance , you &apos;re just making numbers , so probably none of the instructions will actually do this .
1085	that is , instead of remembering ourselves individually , we have standardized , widespread , dispersed patterns of memories that we can hang on our personal memories .
1617	that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to have a lot more color nuances on my palette of music sounds than i &apos;m going to have today .
797	and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here , changes everything .
5294	my first memories are from this boat -- the steady of the engine , the clapping of every wave on the bug , the length and empty horizon .
2291	now , when we go further and we look for old people , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are actually the key thing that people should worry about .
3703	and by the way , we &apos;re walking and circulating and mixing so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find its way .
473	it was exprived in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as alien material , and so at the end we just had one cell with a new chromosome .
2250	a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and i should do that because this love story , like romantic , is also inferior .
2457	everybody thinks i &apos;d gone from &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have fired the nails on a beach somewhere .
5054	and these scientists have just documented the different subjects that these ceo had been doing , and how much time they spent making decisions that are related to the topics .
3484	well , i hope you &apos;ll agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
1883	it looks something like this , who has no freedom for free , can &apos;t be drawn to responsibility for his actions and claims , and therefore he &apos;s unsustainable .
3138	it &apos;s the surviving self that the doctor prives -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; is it going to hurt now when i touch you here ? &quot;
2266	we should call it what it is , which is a scourge , a craft that quickly evokes ecological capital , which allows this production to be done .
4510	and when you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor , and eventually even explode the centrifuge .
509	we &apos;re looking at whether we can use stored co2 that could just be brought to production stores , convert co2 into fuel to drive this process .
4658	so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
6360	what do you think of the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a birthday worker , should be a rescue assistant ?
3907	and they do some tests , and they find that instead of sticking iron and feeding mother , she actually has testicles in her own , and she &apos;s got a y chromosome .
6197	now , with all our digital devices that seven days a week we make 24 hours a day of all these negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
2662	and we start by taking the waste that already exists in those refrigerators or droughts at the reactors , which is our strong fuel .
4076	and as i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe or not , whether you &apos;ve learned from these adventures to wear nothing new .
4939	the opponents for unmoving objects are not just people , but also the light that shines on them and the wind that passes to them and the heat of the space .
4248	but tomorrow , to set the next challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we go from the digital world to the physical world ?
4209	no longer a building that would open up to let it open , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without wet .
4909	and when they play with their particles , they find all kinds of strange things -- how they fly right through walls , or that they can be in two different places at the same time .
5646	what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like some of the other ones that we often meet in our field , is kind of like a semi-logarithmic curve .
5453	and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- maybe most of the electronic health projects fail , because we stopped listening .
3746	and the deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and master the wisdom we &apos;re going to need to make these kinds of decisions ?
3792	now , in our city where volunteers have a high-quality workforce , they have to be pretty early on at the center to be able to mix .
3906	but it &apos;s mostly until it reaches puberty and its breasts grow and evolve , but you don &apos;t get your period until someone comes to it being something different .
5284	i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to push us apart , but we did survive .
2788	it demands that we all turn our senses to the task , and that we use our thinking optimally , like our feelings and our doing , in the challenge that we face .
261	there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription prescription drugs for people like you and me that , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy it .
3552	i would write it this way : not the most powerful of its species survive , and not the most intelligent of its species , but the one that can best adapt to change .
60	now , of all the people i &apos;ve met were the os from the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern colombia , the most extraordinary .
222	the official dogma works like this : when our goal is to maximize the well-being of our citizens , this is all about the maximizing of the freedom of the individual .
5694	in fact , the drops grew , which had an optimal compound for growth faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and divided faster .
1340	right now , we &apos;re building mais and losing between 11 and thirty kilograms of 30-pound tons per hectare , or even recruiting that square meter .
576	and what &apos;s going on with the creative corporations is that they make us less secure about the interstate of mind -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
3120	this is true of laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out we are just as penetrous as everyone else .
3554	not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and flourish , is determined by the struggle of the human mind to change through conflicts .
2509	it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a 3.5 foot high truck that has to go under a three-meter bridge , and you can basically squeeze it underneath .
4579	so when i knew i was going to come here to look at the world of branding and sponsoring in a tedtalk , i knew i was going to do something else .
5137	in fact , what you &apos;re looking at is objective , for the first time , had more information than the second time , but i would dare to guess that you would find it real the second time .
582	all you have to do is look at the bitter death numbers of really great minds out of the 20th century , the young and often the individual hand died .
155	most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is , for example , a scan of the congressional library , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapix .
4061	i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually serve for a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping for my very personal chess .
4963	and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just agonized objects that are made together in a small space .
6352	suppose you have a blind loan , and you &apos;re transferred to an operateur whose average performance is 400 in terms of blindness .
6707	the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static , contested building blocks to a world where everything was interactive .
5319	and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t affect the change , angry and inflexible , and carefully filled children , trapped between two worlds .
4457	my call to all of you who are flying today is , imagine that the same thing is happening on your flight -- please not -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
3702	and secondly , as a species , we have conformed our environment so that we have managed to adapt to us just as much as we adapt to them .
676	there could be a real , wonderful , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the foreign , external thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
3074	so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
2365	i annoyed my father until he finally found out a diving school in buffalo , new york , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
5661	there have never been before in the history of technology development , this kind of recursive growth , where the scale order of magnitude increases exponentially every few years .
2377	of course , the stories that i chose were from the science fiction field , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
3242	now , very briefly , another reason that we can &apos;t really think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
3187	for the memory of the self , a two week holiday vacation is hardly better than the outrageous vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories added .
4690	i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes something positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting odds and humidity . &quot;
6287	last month , i had the pleasure of announcing the qualcommand foundation called &quot; $ 10 million qualcomm tricorder x prize . &quot;
1918	there was just that there was self-administrative alternatives , and one of them was just sitting in crossberg in the multi-setting , where you suspected evil .
5345	i &apos;ve now gone out of my comfort zone to know that , yes , the world is breaking apart , but not the way you fear it .
2419	because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect for , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
5310	and there were the rare but painful choir of &quot; shame eye , &quot; and here and there &apos;s mutings : &quot; asite , going home . &quot;
4210	and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how the people who use the things we design .
2053	she came from a man , an african-american , sympathetic , rau , homeless , who played on a violin , who had only two strings .
5557	it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country writing up and writing government apps every day in their own communities .
1909	and it hit me in the middle of the eight-year-old years after berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t have that in carlsruh .
607	they believed that creativity was a kind of divine divinity , which comes from a distant , unknown source to human beings -- for explanatory , unknown reasons .
4361	armstrong twittered about us and then , in december , the time-magazine taught us when one of the 50 great inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
3114	i &apos;ve let some people count the number of books that have been published in the title of the last five years , and they spent about 40 happiness , and there &apos;s a lot more .
3883	and in this scenario , you can imagine , in one case , the sperm is wearing an y chomosom hitting the x chromosome of the egg cell .
6466	and i went back through the same torture of shame and self-doubt , feeling refreshing and went into the work until it happened again and again and again .
3969	they were the contention that people who had political power should have this political power because of the inherited bloodline from grandfather to son and so on .
4967	it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
1270	it doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours , but your employer , or someone can think about how he &apos;s going to do it with the four hours .
3376	urgency optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to master a barrier , along with the belief that we have a well-established hope for success .
6023	it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
501	we have the second and third generation fuels that are coming out pretty soon that will have much higher atrocities , like octanium or different kinds of butanol .
4534	so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where during the chasing chase , the monitoring camera will be fed with video recordings before .
5099	so the people who decided to participate , rather , had more opportunities available to them , the more they rented to choose actia and fonds .
469	we find all species here that have taken a second chromosome , or a third of any species , each time , adding thousands of characteristics in just one second to a species .
297	a colleague of mine had access to investment records of vanguard , the giant fund society of about a million collaborators and about 2,000 different jobs .
3877	and so , my primate cameroes , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together , as we rediscover the creativity of cameroon and the wonder .
3844	we know them as &quot; love rather than war &quot; monkeys , because they have frequent , ancient sex , interacting with partners , and rules like that , and social features .
1246	that means , look , if you know this now , look at who you &apos;re looking at for a long time , because i don &apos;t take a vote for what can happen according to you .
3358	so here we have a complete parallel journey in which young people are just learning what it means to be a good player , like everything else they &apos;re learning in school .
6408	and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , i left the hospital , and i went to the parking lot to drive home with the car when i did something else i didn &apos;t do .
2028	and we &apos;re just trying to make it clear that you can break down the capacity , the pattern run capacity , just by getting electrochemical stores on the net .
3701	and the reason for that is , first of all , through medicine , we were able to get a lot of genes that were otherwise chosen and would have been removed from the population .
6683	so if we keep thinking about things like this , the obvious answer to people is , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but i don &apos;t care because i &apos;m a good citizen .
3863	play is a formal transducer , and it can take many forms that some of which are a little quiet , imaginative , curious -- maybe to find the amazement again .
3315	this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we &apos;re better at play than in real life .
2690	some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance at all because it might make you axe , so you keep eating , because you know you &apos;re going to save your heart surgery .
1945	how big would you actually have to be a battery to get an island like this on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe seven percent renewable .
4811	18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i started doing something with museums and art , and my boss , who is now , gave me a green light .
577	my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist .
4906	but i &apos;ll bet that the game with the threshold taught him a very valuable lesson , which is that the big things don &apos;t just let you stop , and that they stay in a place .
4946	in which we gave him a little push , we were able to make it vibrating at the same time and not vibrating -- something that was only allowed in the quantum mechanics .
208	i get it right ? your software allows you , at a certain time , within the next few years , all of the images that are used by somebody in the world are basically connected to each other ?
1507	just the things that disappeared , like shoe soles , like brake bugs , like cars , that need to be that they &apos;re going to go into biological systems .
1102	so , of course , this may sound insane in the context of my talk , because we &apos;re physically moving in unexistential , virtual worlds , just after the holodeck model .
3449	i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? &quot; and this particular question is , i &apos;ve devoted my work at the institute for the past few years .
282	we can watch our kids play at the football , and we have our mobile phone on the one hip , and our blackberry on other hips , and probably our laptop on our lap .
5107	so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different kinds of research places -- that you can just apply in your business .
3485	we have all these superpowers , happy productivity , the ability to tap close social nets , the urgency optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
3197	i have the impression that if we make vacation , it &apos;s very often the case , that means we make vacation largely in the service of memory itself .
3921	and it wasn &apos;t until he got 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he arranged inside , that the doctors found out he was female inside .
595	and it &apos;s very likely that all i &apos;m going to write from now on is being rented by the world as the work that came after the experience of my last book &apos;s success , right ?
2203	and we bent around the corner , and we had the most incredible look , thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker flamingos , literally a pinker carpet so far the eye goes .
6452	two years later , i had a service at the emergency center in a community hospital just north of toronto , and i was watching a 25-year-old man with rich rays .
1052	the author of the storytelling animal , jonathan gottschall , we &apos;re still interacting with thousands of hours every year with the receptions of stories .
5723	so these communities began to evolve , so that the level in which evolution was no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community that we call organism .
1287	that means , if we look at that we can transfer existing action models from one to another , for example , the metaphor , then i can use that tape as a creator .
4224	but then this could be just a 3d cloud of imagery where you can go and move through which you can see from many , many directions .
4466	now , if we succeed to commit the systems that control the numbers and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
2316	now , after i &apos;ve chosen government , i realize that the wiki pediatories , which are the most cover of time magazine , are people of the year .
5378	you can see who we were , and how life shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come to our lives might have come into us .
788	so we set it on the top of the line to spend an enormous amount of money in order to get an advertising operation on the way to get the truth about coal .
4025	and part of me is , what if the content of a character was something that would be machine readable in the future -- could be made visible by the fmri ?
4471	the data gets transferred into the gray box , damages the centrifuge and the iranian nuclear energy program shifts -- permission .
5	we have to deal with the unstoppable separation of death , and so we shouldn &apos;t be surprised that we all sing , dancing and art .
872	we &apos;re starting to have the management voice in two sequencing siftways , and arrange them in a row , expand them and add a little bit more of the voice .
2116	&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far out in the ocean that you don &apos;t pollute the environment . &quot;
4298	i have a company that makes design and animations , and graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire and pay attention to in the art world .
422	the exciting phase came when we took this piece of informed chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
1234	so , very , very exciting processes , which then , in this one , yes , gray , it &apos;s actually not , but it &apos;s actually going to happen here in this rosane mass .
1957	and the wind plant , or the solar plant , or whatever it is , is usually a back-up system , or a system , which can only be stored in small amounts here .
2047	and this is a little bit of our vision of a sensible energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful to cradle that they said they use solar energy .
4322	first , we got the insurance of the doors in , and actually , for tempt , we got a device that can communicate with -- a stephen hawking machine .
1992	and wizingly , in the &apos; 70s , at bc mannheim , today abb , has been developed and then it &apos;s licensed to the japanese .
3084	so i &apos;m proposing , if you get really bad , then look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to make the first hot part in the back here .
1057	but to me , in the realm of interactive media , what &apos;s so striking is that , by our biological memory , we &apos;ve inherited the ability to think nonlinear .
4666	and my friends , who make great , gigantic hollywood films , say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners they have .
3278	it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will argue whether they want to explore experience happiness , or whether they want to explore life grades , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
3974	if you look at the history of the founding fathers , it becomes clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world .
3006	if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to do it the way we &apos;ve been guilty of something we don &apos;t think we want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
2872	about 12 years ago , a story was published , a horrible story , which brought the autism epidemic to the masers , mumps , and the vaccines .
3714	so think , if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to anticipate genetic adaptations in the body that would cure and prepare disease .
2829	water , urgent land , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re disappearing , soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re also disappearing .
2674	and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies that , if their approaches work , can provide funding for their pilots .
5938	when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this sixpack beer with my sister and i sat down and went to the forest .
1021	the second thing is , since we &apos;ve been through this archaic model , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very billy , although today we use a coded language .
2805	this is the great time that ever existed on this planet , no matter what scale you put on : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining disease .
164	and that really gives you the pleasure , and the good experience of reading a real paper output of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium of a multi-size medium .
919	here in the image on the upper left you see bio-level , that &apos;s a hackerspace , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a nonprofit facility where everybody can get to .
2958	now , the most brain epidemic that we &apos;re in right now is this absurd struggle between the advocates of genetically modified food and bio-elite .
5717	the transition place is now where these communities are so close together that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a sign chain on dna .
4181	the other thing is , we believe that when we see every day , the cup that we throw away doesn &apos;t just go away , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
5716	so they either survived together , or they went together , which meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were recovered more often , and they preferred by evolution .
1258	usability always means how i can achieve a certain goal quickly , or how can a user be enabled in a particular user context of effective , efficient and satisfactory achieve a goal .
6272	yes , there &apos;s 97.5 percent salt water , two percent are insulted , and we &apos;re fighting about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
3541	and to be honest , the only real and persistent disability that i had to deal with is that the world is constantly meant to describe me with these definitions .
5002	that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who said we have to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the route to bring our country forward .
548	now , of course , in a form of accidents like this , again , the debate about the value of science and engineering on such boundaries -- it &apos;s easy to reject that .
6593	now you might think that the problem was given to people who surely , when they lived in predatory societies , animals were killing , and they were only aware of what they were doing after a few generations .
5146	the little thing that we felt was that we asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving money .
4187	it started with a question of the mayor who came to us and said that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public places as part of architecture .
1821	and then when this luftune comes out about the people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with the spirit , with nature that can only live , right with the soul .
5659	so if the transportation technology was going to continue as fast as the microprocessor technology would continue , we could get into a taxi tomorrow , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
602	somehow , i have to find a way from now to writing a safe distance between me and my very natural climbing about how the response will be at the level of writing .
145	they represent part of the human imagination that goes back in recent times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the geography of hope .
920	kids , old , all kinds of people going there , just to sit down with them , they &apos;ve set up a lab , and look at what you can do when these protocols are turned on .
4363	and probably there will be the toughest representatives of the street scenes -- banksy , shepard fairey , caws -- all these guys will be there .
5264	tastemaker , creator participants , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture where everybody has access to and determines popularity in the audience .
708	if you may just believe that you &apos;re a loan -- an incredible source for a reader &apos;s time in your life that &apos;s passed on to somebody else , if you &apos;re done with it .
2081	this is why we make music : so that we have something that exists inside us all , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
6262	this year , for the first time , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the same strains -- 8.8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
104	the sioux indians didn &apos;t stop being on sioux , when they were bent and arrow of assignments that americans stopped being americans when they were doing horses and horses .
2436	she made me realize this telepresence experience that you could use such robotic avatars and your own consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
6056	there &apos;s no boundary in terms of technology and design that allows us to be fully human as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , border and injustice .
283	and even though they &apos;re all shut down , every minute in which we watch our child &apos;s mutilation of a football game , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ?
1272	so when we go back to the area of software , here &apos;s the first command line interfaces , which were very abstract , where you used months to deal with these systems .
5876	in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you use the video of the ipads , and through augmented reality , we &apos;re seeing an animation of 11 that appear on a plant in front of the house .
2878	it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we think what we see , what we believe , what makes us feel real .
6410	and there was another nurse , not the nurse who had seen printer , but another three words to me , and those three words feared the most emergency physicians i know .
3543	maybe the current concept that &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s inside a broken , and how we fix it , for each individual , is a greater disability than the pathology itself .
1521	these are the first shoes where you can put the cavalian launch on the pedestrian pile , and the rubber can go in biological cycles , right ?
5610	but it &apos;s this obligation that makes this thing that we own , and that we pay for , something that works against us , something else , and then we made ourselves away .
2085	and i &apos;m always going to play with nathaniel , whether in the walt disney concert hall or in skid row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
2004	the beauty is that , in fact , on this island , you can basically take away all of this today on problems that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our share of renewables .
5040	there are a lot of businesses that would like to be in america , especially in one place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
5747	telephony , computers , video captains , cd-roms , and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
5706	so if anyone wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
952	one project that i did with the hackteria network in switzerland itself was that we wanted to build a so-called optical trap or optical pink chain .
5780	take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their subroutines , and the kids inherited the characteristics of the subroutines from the two programs .
3126	and the third one is the focus illusion , and this is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that influences well-being without destroying its meaning .
3429	we set games to get away from everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not satisfying in real life , and we get what we need from the play .
3544	if we don &apos;t treat a human being continuously , and we don &apos;t perceive and perceive all of its power and its possibilities , in addition to the natural struggle that you might need to have , we create another disease .
836	there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or logic games , where we give people the power of the quick process and see the results immediately .
2233	i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it mad . i don &apos;t like it crushed .
4310	so i came up with the need to just expose a check , and instead i made a check that i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how to solve it .
1704	if in an environment where adults do active music , or at least hear some active music , a child grows up , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color does your flower have ?
4051	and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we move democracy beyond anatomy -- to think less about the individual body in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
4303	i just want to talk to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people communicate with these devices ? &quot;
3751	they &apos;re not something else but they put them in the morning that gives them extra strength and will continue to increase their velocity , and that will help them , for example , keep their balance .
5307	every dollar was divided and was put into further education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for it , and most of the time , the new things that came from two hands .
3224	the distinction between the happiness of the living self and the satisfaction of the memory itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
2748	the average for most people is about 50 inches , bl students , half of them , lawyers are doing something more , but not much , child gardening kids are better than adults .
2423	after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main job as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice and become a full-time researcher . &quot;
2055	nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived homeless on the streets of skid row at the center of los angeles .
3287	i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it is to save in online games .
85	so to snuff this powder is about to get shot out of a rifle of a rifle , surrounded by baroque paintings and landing on an ocean of electricity .
2503	now , the exact correlation between a carbon increase and therefore the resulting temperature change and where the other implications are , there are some ambiguity , but not very many .
83	this plant contains some very strong tryptamins that are very similar to the serotonin , dimetayltryptamin in 5 and methoxydiphenylacine .
3580	this was dr. kean , a man i only knew from my mother &apos;s narratives about this day , because i , of course , came to late two weeks to my birthday .
1583	now , there are depictions , whether you learn it for use , just passively understandable , or you can also speak actively , to the musical mother of language .
6401	in fact , it really lacked me so much about self-security that i asked the nurse , who took care of the woman , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she went home ? &quot;
4330	this is a cheap sunglasses that we bought on the beaching ground of venice , something copper , and some stuff from the construction market and the electric commerce .
1023	we all know that interactive media is by definition nonlinear , which involves the linearity sense , and what of course tells us is that we feel the linearity today as normal .
5463	so every morning , i would jump to my wlan-waage , and people would talk to me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; for lunch , i &apos;d like to just do a little salt today , lucien . &quot;
1294	osit osit is going to be about 50 to seven thousand times after activity , so in the sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s often less likely to be pasted than we do in the day .
1195	the right circle looks larger than the small one , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s exactly the same size , and yet our perception changes according to what context we put things in .
5918	that was about 15 or 20 minutes . then she got up and came over to me . she took me by the hand and said , &quot; come , bryan . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
1361	and if you &apos;re telling the people that if you were to deny the people , if you say , that &apos;s better , you &apos;re not there , they &apos;re going to be refining and hostile .
515	that &apos;s what the future might look like with change , could now be able to accelerate the evolutionary tree with synthetic bacteria , archaas , and perhaps eukaryonts .
4999	and i used this graph to show how valuable rohland is in a place like new york , think that a surface in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
4945	instead of it just being quiet there , it vibrated . the way it vibrated was something like this -- like a stretching and gathering bubble belt .
4245	today , for the first time -- and the campaign obamas has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of the networks to the physical world .
1820	and now , from this soul , you think that somehow in this cloudy nature , in this magnificent nature , anima , it &apos;s in the latin , the lufththtub , is present .
2655	once the first one is done , when it goes like this , it &apos;s all clear , because the economy , the energy density , is so different from nuclear power as we know it .
407	so we decided that the only way forward is to actually synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to variate the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
693	it was like the time would stand still and the dancer would enter through a form of paper . he didn &apos;t do anything different than he had ever done before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything would fit together .
1251	of course , the shape age is not just about the subject of perceptions and neural processing or cognitive sergonomy , but primarily about the subject of the human object relationship .
1679	it &apos;s not too late in both of them to find out whether they can &apos;t , or learn how to use these little muscles that make the vocal chords right .
84	if you &apos;ve seen the yanoma , as you sniff this stuff , this substance that contains them from different species has also been methoxydical phenyptamin .
2173	they created a 11,000 acres of fish -- barsh , sea shells , shrimp , aal -- and miguel and his company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
1112	and when i say computer games , they &apos;re very likely to think that any people before any consolation , or that they &apos;re playing with any console in their hand .
5096	now if you look at the extremes , the plans that offered two of the fonds , they had a partial rate in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
2534	because of many different successes in the light sector , through other screens , through new methods in housing , there are many services where there are some single services that can be reduced by 90 percent .
4369	and that question should be , every one of you has to ask yourself , and every single day , you have to find something that needs to be done . if not now , when ? and if i don &apos;t , who do i ?
3966	as you all remember , our founding fathers rejected the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
1282	when you get more intuitive , and then i have to put my little friend over here and see what that means because , just from the perspective of cognition , when is there something that &apos;s really intuitive here ?
6616	if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people have been touched by this -- besides the pocahoney story , why were they so touched by the imagery world ?
2391	so i started a company , with my good friend , stan winston , who was the best makeup and creature-designer at the time , which was called &quot; digital domain . &quot;
4488	so we extracted and decommissioned the angriffs code , and we found that it &apos;s structured in two digital warheads -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
5117	but the newest supermarket today , the newest supermarket in the world is aldi , and they only give you 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
2602	the terrapower-concept means that instead of having a part of the uranium , the one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
156	it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can limit the power of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
716	when the dumb divine genius , which is on the side , decides , for a brief moment , to show a miracle through your effort , sophien olé .
2628	we should use the efficiency efforts to get reductions on the way we &apos;re emitting , the less we &apos;re emitting , the less the co2 sum is going to be , and the temperature is going to be .
3268	what &apos;s happening is it &apos;s obvious that money doesn &apos;t give you an experience of luck , but that lack of money will definitely raise you , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
2706	unless you &apos;re very short before a cost-breakthrough and just funded the learning curve , i think we should be trying to do more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
3815	so when i look around this room and see people who have either achieved an atrocious success or their way there , i want to offer that memory : don &apos;t wait .
3551	this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution over 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , pointed to something very true in human character .
3361	it &apos;s based on the great research in cognitive science , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the grinding college of any subject until the 21st year of life , we &apos;ll be mastered in it .
2306	and so you get an idea that if you go through this kind of information , targeted , broader , zooming out , you don &apos;t just look for it or surf .
833	an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to see was that we could apply common gestures to data about how to do colors the way you do it on liquids .
5523	but a particular fellow , a man named erik insel ober , noticed something else , and that was that the residents were free of the sidewalk , right in front of these parts .
834	in this case , we created three siftables as paint pots , and i can use them to pour color in the middle where they &apos;re then mixed .
3246	well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the life itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the thinking self that decides how happy people are .
4604	the greatest car you &apos;ve ever dropped out of &quot; the greatest movie ever 2011 , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , an attention from &quot; the film ever sold . &quot;
3652	do you realize that we can use that , and we can guarantee the mechanisms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetics ?
3975	they went away from explanations of natural species , and they showed things like a supernatural concept of power , where transmission is based on a very vague concepts of birth law .
3749	i want you to imagine now , a portable robot that gives you superhuman capabilities , or another one that helps wheelchair users to stand up and go back .
6645	the u.s. u.s. intelligence agency frog two months ago the swiss account of mr. jain here , and on this conto were 14.9 million u.s. dollars when it was frozen .
6486	and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that an orthopedic in my hospital had taken the wrong leg , they believe me that i had trouble looking at him in the eyes .
511	you know , we really have -- moderate goals like the whole petrochemical industry revenue . right . if you couldn &apos;t do it at ted , where else ? become a source of energy .
4483	the threatening is actually in the gray box when a special configuration has been discovered , even when the special program that tries to infect it is on this goal .
581	but we writers seem to have this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creatives of all the genres , seem to have this call , to be mentally unstable .
1900	and once you have that opportunity to feel that three-sentence in other people , you do , because you will make other people happy if you don &apos;t remember your self-lying that way .
6518	the newly defined doctor is a human being , you know , to accept his humanity , accepted her , is not proud to make errors , but everything comes out of them so that it can be passed .
2712	he &apos;s still associated with his earlier stories , with the skepticist camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s now doing the research argument .
3514	it &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . it &apos;s an italo american whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . so he &apos;s always called dr. p.
278	work -- we &apos;re blessed with how carl pointed out , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every single place on the planet -- all the way to the randolph hotel .
431	part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and that have to sleep with other 50-letter pieces to build smaller sub-units to fit those together .
6276	it can produce thousands of gallons of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether it &apos;s saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a gallon .
159	to prove that it &apos;s really a text and not an image , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real presentation of texts and no image .
5364	without support of her husband , she cared for a sensation by putting him on trial and claughter in her own case , and an even bigger conversation than she won .
4362	the coolest part is -- and this is what makes the whole circle -- that there &apos;s this april , where moca is going to be an exhibition in the inner city of los angeles called &quot; the art of the streets . &quot;
29	so today , i &apos;d like to take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a short journey across the ethnosphere , to try to make you understand what actually has been lost .
6214	consider that a large percentage of americans living under the poverty line have access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , mobile phones , climate systems and cars .
375	now , as a fundamental question -- i &apos;m almost done -- i &apos;m sort of a question that &apos;s sort of thinking about this , which is , what makes all this choice possible in the industrialized societies , is the material of wealth .
4526	the little explosile takes over a cascade , and flips the reactors , and slows them down , and the big explosile comes out with six cascades in interaction and manipulates valves .
2491	climate degradation means that their sentences are not going to grow for many years ; we &apos;re going to rain too much or too little . things are going to change the way their fragile environment can &apos;t sustain .
6344	this is going to hit the ball in the field , it &apos;s going to come up , it &apos;s not going to be caught , and who tried to throw the ball to the first base , didn &apos;t do it in time , and the runner was in security .
2010	you can do it through the n smart-grid , you can do it by making the net , yes , you should , in any case , hear the percentage , but you will never be able to get rid of the memory completely .
3841	meat and the decline of the tree is that you couldn &apos;t even fill a stadium with the linked bonobos -- and even there we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
1255	but there are also symbolic functions , why is there any one for such a little bit of activity , where there &apos;s very little bit of money in it , even though it &apos;s not that convenient ?
828	this sift is designed for the video repertoire , and when i flip it into a direction , the video is played forward ; when i tip it in the other direction , it &apos;s going to go backwards .
128	the canadian government has not always worked very well with the inuit , and during the 50th years of the establishment of our regime , they were forced to move into settlements .
6394	i didn &apos;t pick up the hearing and do what i was supposed to have done , which would have been a phone call on my chief to tell him , so he &apos;d had a chance to take his own picture .
4731	md : this world ? i think the world of your world is the world in which you live -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so on .
4664	so what they started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is going to be understood is a huge problem .
3914	the consequence is that someone like me actually had a brain that was more androgenic than a woman who was born with testicles and had an androgenic defect .
1572	because in this verbal landscape description , the fragrance of flowers is not to smell , the degree of the founding is just to stop hearing the spikes of the wind , not feeling .
5066	otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is , are you ready to hear about the decision-overload problem ?
4264	the icebery around me raped 18 meters out of the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year after year .
6097	finally , a society is not measured in how they treated their rich and mighty and privileged , but how they relate to the poor , the conviction , the incarcerated .
6471	i arranged the x-rays of the kidney , and when that was without finance , my colleague of the patient &apos;s reconciliation set a harm in the lower right-hand sector and called the operators .
2465	so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and deserve in the opposite respect of that respect .
3955	and as a result , we get caught with the really difficult question of when someone is dead , and it brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to .
1605	as you see a happy new day over and over again , despite the same rituals of life , standing up , breakfast , going to work , i do the same thing over and over again .
34	all of this is rooted in the mythological past , and the strange thing about these big houses , where , because of the mischief , six or seven languages are spoken , is that you never hear somebody who learns language .
2361	but here was a world that i could actually enter here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all that i had always imagined when i read these books .
6739	a couple of weeks ago , we took littps to risd , and we gave them some designers who had no experience whatsoever -- just carton , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do it . &quot;
3778	these are also batteries , the engine engine is on your hip , as well as the one on your knee joints that you move forward in this very slippery and very natural gangs .
2048	and that &apos;s what we do , and that &apos;s the way we do , and that &apos;s the presentation of premium kola , that you can be a collective again , and use solar energy , a little bit together .
5554	but what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents a new generation that accommodes the problem of government -- not as the problem of a sold institution , but as a problem of collective action .
4165	you see the image of the place called co massimo , where , since the roman time , people have gone to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the impact at the end of the day .
464	in archaebacteria , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but only recently we &apos;ve shown that you can take a full transplant from one chromosome to the other and activate it .
6052	it &apos;s this head-heart-heart connection that i think drives us , not just to be open to all the bright and exciting things , but also for the dark and problematic things .
1162	the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , it &apos;s an awful lot of mechanisms , principles and archaic thinking patterns from the tribal society .
5741	i &apos;m sitting here and basically giving me cruel sounds , hoping to create a sort of confused idea in your head that has a kind of similarity to my original idea .
2245	it &apos;s a river that takes all the things , from which rivers today tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , abundance of pests .
1812	after which logic is this illusion , this self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the one we actually know about in the unconscious , that it &apos;s valid to spread outside .
5295	i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came out of a lot of times , but deceived from the death of the men on our boat , or the fall of the engine that six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
5383	can i give you a bug in your life that drives courageously any wave , the riddled , steady tuckers of the engine , the vast horizon , that guarantees nothing ?
6504	and then i take the same patient with chest pain , and i sweat it , and i sweat it , and i add a little bit of an alcoholic breath on it , and all of a sudden , the story is covered in contempt .
3208	imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the vacation , all of your images get annihilated , and you get an amnesiac drug so you won &apos;t remember anything .
3788	it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the wheelchair drivers , but for everyone .
3357	first of all , for kids in the united states , 10.080 hours is the accuracy they spend in school , from the 5th grade to the degree of high school -- if you don &apos;t ever miss .
2686	bg : when you get into this situation , it &apos;s like having too much food , and you &apos;re just standing in front of a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something like that .
5193	every one of these techniques i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you offer service .
314	well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about , it &apos;s just to imagine attractive properties of alternatives that you &apos;re excluding , that makes you less satisfied with the alternatives you &apos;ve chosen .
4273	i think of my footage of these icebergs as if i made portraits of my ancestors in the awareness that they exist in these individual moments , and they will never exist that way again .
3594	and maybe that change could happen because i &apos;ve encountered so many people who have opened my doors instead of encountering people who wanted to constrain me or have an idea behind me .
2687	there &apos;s a research direction called geoengineering , which involves various techniques to delay global warming , so we could get 20 or 30 years longer to get together .
3690	from an evolutionary point of view , you and i , like boster rockets , are designed to send the genetic question to the next stage of the orbit to drop in the ocean .
4049	that is to say , there could be something on average , which is different from female brains from male brains , which makes us much more attention to complex social relations , and to make more attention to protective needs .
5760	i live professionally from building computers , and i know that i can &apos;t use the mechanism that i use to build computers without the recent advancements in computer technology .
4324	and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you &apos;re talking to him , or you get an email , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m so unworthy , this guy is incredible . &quot;
4013	so for example , texas , at one point , decided to marry a man means you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and marry a woman means you have a y chromosome .
495	if you can imagine making these 20 million different genes or optimizing these processes to make octanium or drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology with just a small team than the last 20 years of science .
2326	pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we bring this zoom-technology to every single website like this .
2718	the idea is quite simple . four teams have to build the largest free-standing structure with 20 spaghetti , about a meter of tape , about a meter of thread and a marshmallow .
383	if something of what enabled the people of our society to make such decisions to the societies in which people have gone down to less choice , not only would life improve people , but would be improved in our dignity .
6113	and i started with this mission . the headline said , &quot; my poor , 14-year-old black clients like a privileged , white , 75-year-old top managers . &quot;
2947	none of them -- gingko , fraud , echinacea , fraud , acai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it , it &apos;s fraud .
5699	in other words , they found a way in this insane , evolutionary way that allowed them to write down what they were made of , so that this information could be stored and copied .
2669	this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built it , so everybody who has implemented a fast reactor is a candidate for our first .
5490	and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like knot points , to crowdsource these aeds all over the world .
2524	if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , health care and reproduction medicine , we could probably reduce that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re going to see a tilt by 1.3 .
3946	as we keep pushing our science further , we &apos;re getting increasingly into a zone of discomfort , where we need to recognize that the kind of styles that we probably have had are too simple .
2969	now we can make it more precise . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to extend their lives .
3798	the other volunteer who just arrived in front of me -- let &apos;s call him lex luther -- reached the main man first , and was asked to go into the house and save the dog of the house owner .
3667	in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just about to measure briefly ; the animal kingdom , like a single beat ; and the human life , a small emergency history .
930	or , in some way , what you usually understand from a lab is that these are sort of discarded machines , extremely expensive , extremely divided , just for professionals , trained academics with ph.d. titles and so on .
341	he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying all of these damn jeans , and i quit the store -- and i say the truth -- with the best passenger jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
5657	now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say , a transportation technology , that would happen on the semi-logarithmic scale very unreasonably , in the shape of a flat line .
6310	one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that big companies and governments could only do in the past .
3755	now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about american soldiers , who on average is about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the question that they should carry more equipment .
818	and as they realized how to reach out and grab the hands , take the jokes and move them , they actually learned how to think and solve problems through understanding and changing the spatial coherence .
771	and the coal industries and oil industries have spent a quarter billion dollars last year in the last year to rate clean coal , which is already a contradiction in itself .
984	so , at the moment , that &apos;s the key cause of the scene to increase this availability of technology , and also increase the information and the understanding that more people can get engaged in there .
884	the thought that i &apos;d like to leave you with is that we have the threshold to this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that bring information to our world that corresponds to our demands .
4475	the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , in terms of the windows- part , the droppery part , made out of countless shattering .
4386	i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to do work on aids organizations .
3058	but if you change the shape in which you give the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and you color that blue and you put a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurably more effective .
910	but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program it , and you can actually hack it , like that , and i found this incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
4970	it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , they would be able to choose the possibility between at least one hand of many different cities that everybody in competition to compete with new residents .
959	and he &apos;s got one of these , you know , one of these brain wave measures , like e.e.e. , or something like that , so he &apos;s been dealing with neurobiology , his nickname is neurosam neurohack .
3225	the gallup organization has a global poll where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experience , and there were other efforts in the direction .
763	look at the region of the eastern pacific , right , from the american continent west and aside from the indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline of oxygen in the ocean .
6201	perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century is going to accelerate through a series of forces so strong that in the next three decades , we will be able to create a world of the surplus .
6069	i sat there one day , and i listened to these women , and after a couple of hours , woman parks turned to me and said , &quot; well bryan , tell me what the initiative for the same is right .
134	he was peeling out , dropping his pants out of seaweed fur and putting his hand in his hand , and when the feces started frozing , he shaped it into the form of a knife .
4368	i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with autism technology , but i just captured something and surrounded myself with amazing people so we could put something on the legs together .
25	and yet , this horrible destiny actually happens to someone anywhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly man dies , and takes the last syllable of an old language with herself .
3768	we often talk about very young people with spinal cord cord injuries , who have been hit in the blosmal of their life -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s -- by the destiny , and the wheelchair is the only option .
2656	to really understand this : this means building deep into the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , this consumed uranium , and then the process starts up and continues to work down ?
702	but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer wakes up himself and realizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he no longer has a fifth of god in himself .
2728	and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and they put it gently on the top , they step back , and they go , &quot; ta-da ! &quot; admire your work .
1158	and now we come to the next generation , and the exciting thing is , like , a generation transition is just every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomenal stage that we &apos;re doing this .
1305	because i can reach things like the bits , touch them , and they come up to me is much more natural than when , over hierarchically organized websites or other mechanisms , to sort of make these things accessible .
206	and of course , by the way , all of these are the huge virtual models of each interesting part of the earth , not just being kept from flooding or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
199	the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and we &apos;re now collecting data from all of them -- from the whole collective storage of what , visually , the earth looks like -- and everything is being connected together .
4854	i did a little bit of research , and i spoke to some of the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squail , where a gang on the fast tuesday is being beaten with a stick .
6678	for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , we found the so-called state belt , which was a trojan that was used by german government representatives to reclaim their own citizens .
6659	and last week in a meeting with the dutch government representatives , i asked one of the senior leaders of this group to ask if he was able to do it because of the diginotar hacks people had died .
5256	i admit , i wasn &apos;t very interested , when a friend said to me , i should look at this great video about a guy protesting in new york against courtile titles for bicycles .
5617	it &apos;s a group of troubled citizens who wrote a very detailed 325-page report , which is an answer to the security memo about the legislation of the financial reform .
1576	that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole thing in german , because if i had to translate it into english again , it would be equivalent to me to translation the translation of translation .
4189	and one of the ideas that was mediated in a workforce was to imagine these tubes , and valves , magnet valves , valves that open and close .
6480	here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t close my errors and talk about them , if i have the quiet voice that tells me , what can &apos;t really find me , then how can i share it with my colleagues ?
3351	ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend playing now , it just makes sense when you think about time in terms of the order of human development , which is extraordinary .
5092	and what we were looking at was whether the number of subscriptions that were possible to have a rental design plan , the 401 plan , the chance to affect whether more is saved for tomorrow .
1782	so you can see how slowly this mechanism is resolving , and what it looks like is the traces that it leaves that lead to something else but to this magnificent picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
1858	but with this logic , which just uses it , that two sentences are logical correctly , and a third one hangs on that looks like he &apos;s got something to do with that , so we can save our livelihood .
3471	you know jerry bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the &quot; dream-team , &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-beaching , and all together they can save the world .
268	in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one , and they got married as quickly as they could , and then they got children as quickly as they could .
4809	i made a check in my pocket on the top of the ted organization , the sapling foundation -- a check at 7100 dollars to fund my ted encounter the next year .
463	it &apos;s as much easier if you do it in eukaryonts as we are : you just take the nucleus out and you put another one in there , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clones .
633	and there are certainly people in this audience who would really convenient scientific doubt about the notion of -- fundamentally -- feathers that people would follow and use fatty on their projects and so on .
355	today , in the world we live in -- we wealthy , industrialized people , with perfection as an expectation -- the best thing you can hope for is things as good as you expect it from them .
2661	bg : yeah . well , what happens to the waste : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it , and you put it in the next reactor , and then you burn it .
2072	we started talking about music , from bach to beethoven , brahms , bruckner and all the other bs , from bartok to esa pekka salons .
4660	see , when i was a kid and my father caught me lying -- and he &apos;s sitting there and looking at this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions in every story .
2256	and if you claim that these are the things that ensure the future of good food , somebody stands up somewhere and says , &quot; hey guys , i love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
964	another thing that comes from the united states , which has to do with this sort of father history , is the p.c.r , which is the polymer label response , complicated word .
1595	but over time , as an interpreter , you have a rich knowledge of the composers you play more often , and it always makes you feel easier to think and feel yourself in it .
1606	i &apos;ve become a day older , changing seasons , my pulse goes down at night slower than in the morning , in a concert hall it takes longer for the sound to come back than at home .
417	there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
3930	so we have the concept that being a woman is about having a female identity ; being a black person is supposed to have an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
5140	it &apos;s about the fact that people , in order to understand the difference between possibilities , have to understand what the consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that these consequences need to be alive and concrete .
3479	i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in development areas that benefit from being together to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world .
5151	it turns out that in the way of the supermarkets up and down in the northeast , it varies the number between 31 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 64 newspapers .
3472	but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody &apos;s in the dream-team , and it &apos;s our job of creating the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
218	i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book that i hope are related to other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
2407	we actually created a reality six months later that i found myself in a russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a bulleye .
908	and it &apos;s just been generated with software , but there &apos;s also an electronics area , there &apos;s also a whole baking scene that &apos;s done with electronics circuits all kinds of things .
4001	just because of the fact that maria was born three months ago , she demands all sorts of rights three months before heinrich -- having the right inconvenient sex , choose the right to drink the right .
1598	now that the notes represent everything but an accurate record of the love of the composer , but only a scaffold , i now turn to this framework to restore it with meaning and meaning .
6371	in my anatomic lecture , i learned the origins and runners of every muscle , every branch of every artery , which takes away from the aorta , obscure and ordinary differential diagnoses .
3734	and then the analytical technology , the same engine in science that can enable the change to prevent disease , could also enable us to adopt goodbye super-attribute , hyper-capacity -- the better memory .
2429	now , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic in a submersible , and i &apos;m seeing planks that sort of resemble these board here , and i know that the band used to play there .
1877	so if you have this notion that you &apos;re sort of driven in nature , determined by the larger pile that drags you immediately , then you also quickly feel that there must be something like free will .
5022	and shortly after that , on january 19th , they voted to congress for a change in the constitution to have a compulsive regime that &apos;s reliable in particular development areas .
193	i suspect you can see that these are a lot of different kinds of cameras : all of this is in the way , from the mobile phone camera to professional slrs , quite a large number of them that have all been flooded together in this environment .
3037	now , this is a trick that i often teach young kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closely , although it &apos;s a very easy trick to do .
976	you put d.n.a on gold particles and the gold particles , and then the gold particles in those air pressure pistols , and then i shot those on barrels , and then made them light with it .
5081	we put in six different flavors there , or 24 different flavors of tastes , and we looked at two things : first , what would more people stand and try marking ?
2061	i have to mention that nathaniel did a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electric shocks and thorazine and handcuffs , a trauma that has followed him all his life .
3251	but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re happier , because when you think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded of how terrible the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;re going to feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
5534	there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. section of the city of honolulu , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but in order for the citizens to adopt the tsunami sires .
5482	we set up a website and asked a crowd , &quot; if you see an aed , please share with us where he is , when he got up , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business , of course .
912	there &apos;s hackteria dot org , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with a cooperation in india that has now members or active people all over the world .
927	and what you can do with that , and you can just sort of figure out what society is going to do with it , and ask , &quot; okay , what do you know , what do you want to do , do you have an interest in bringing you into that ? &quot;
2382	the movie didn &apos;t bring any money , actually , he was just playing his production costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotized by the magic that it ran out of it .
2729	but then , almost always , what happens is that the ta-da becomes a &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallows causes the whole thing to bend and fall in .
3185	from the point of view of the herself , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two week &apos;s vacation is twice as good as the one on the weekly vacation .
1239	if i know something takes three seconds for me to sort of leap out of the present into the last loop , i can also bridge very well waretime i &apos;m going to do it in three seconds .
4428	the second thing that i learned that day -- and that was when we missed the george washington bridge , pretty much about the species of hair -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really regret .
4803	and that said , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; welcome transparency , &quot; was given to you by my good friends of emc who paid $ 7100 for the name rights of ebay .
1187	but i have to understand , at the heart , in nature , when information becomes information , when will information become information , and information , again , so i know how to make things intuitive , or , of course , available .
3424	and they would be so deep into the cube game , because games are so fascinating and surrounding us with satisfying , happy productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
4201	or you could close the building and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this day when you &apos;re driving down the roof , you get images of people who were there saying , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
3590	and i also changed my thinking over the course of time , if they had asked me , at the age of 15 , if i had swapped my prosthetic legs out of flesh and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have been hesitating for a second .
3612	the only real disability is a broken mind that has been broken has no more hope ; it can &apos;t find anything beautiful ; it lacks our natural , childish curiosity , and our innate ability of imagination .
1293	the model is already exploded in the womb , and it &apos;s intercultural , so it works around the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time for us all the time , and most of us have ever known that this model is there .
2001	and what we &apos;ve done since two thousand was then the hall was finished , until now , two-thousand-12 basically everything that was done here between the single system of electronics , to software , we &apos;ve done .
3537	there are odds and challenges in life , and they &apos;re just too universal , and each person is going to do it differently , but the question is not whether we can deal with the odds or not , but how we get to that .
3739	and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attribute that we want , we will be transformed from alt style to neo-evolution .
3548	we should not deny those challenging times or deny them , we should not try to avoid them , nor should we turn them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing the odds in the widrives .
4216	imagine you could have little helicopters going through the air , and each one of them with a little clip of change , almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
3613	but if we manage to support the human mind , continue to hope to hope for ourselves and other people around them to be beautiful , curiosity and imaginative , then we truly embed our forces in a really positive way .
6383	and when i listened to her chest with the stethoscope , i could hear a big noise on both sides , which told me that she suffered from congestive heart failure .
1296	and through this kind of compiling , much like the metaphor of the desktop , but now it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a action pattern , a principle of action .
1171	in front of the background , i &apos;ve just been looking at this , because what it means is , actually , what else is natural for us , what have we probably lost , but what is also instinctive , so what makes the difference ?
4468	but if we can do it , an effective windowdowdows-virus enters a laptop that &apos;s used by a waiting engineer to configure that gray box , we &apos;re in the business .
36	or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who have first been contacted peaceful in 1958 .
2439	so after these expeditions , we started to really appreciate what we saw down there , for example , these deep sea wells , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , and these are sort of aliens , but here on earth .
6682	they use tools like the state belt to interrogate their computers with a trojan that allows them to monitor their entire communication , listen to their online discussions , gather their passwords .
3123	i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could limit it , but in the big and large , this is something we need to be given up , and we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated perspective on what well-being is .
6264	this came out last month with a study that shows that by the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar power is six cents a cow , compared to 15 cents a national average .
2489	and this may be surprising , because my full-time job at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seed to deliver the things we need to invent and deliver to make the poorest two billion a better life .
1916	i &apos;m grateful to the premium-cola person that he rehabilitated the word again , because after the decline , you didn &apos;t have to use the word anymore , because all the left was bad .
6288	we &apos;re asking teams around the world to connect all of these technologies together in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can check in and test your blood values .
4894	some of us may have chosen for one of these extremes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a big aptitute , which is also in both hemisphere bears .
178	one is seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is from noah snavely , a university university university of washington , under the counseling of steve seitz at uw .
2179	okay ? there we were , and we fought through the wetlands , and i &apos;m cooking and sweat , has a muchin to my knees , and miguel keeps a biological reader in silence .
5679	and we know it &apos;s just not going to make sense right now , to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different that a simple wedding of what we &apos;re doing now makes no sense .
3370	the game industry is developing consoles that save energy and work on mobile networks , rather than the broadband internet , so that players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , can play online .
5487	and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks you can also find your micro-software cell phone to find the next aed that can save your life .
2705	you get too big amounts of money , and here you can disagree with people sensible , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and you try to finance that , and for me , most of this is what &apos;s going on .
3329	so , first of all , when you get into one of these online games , especially in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to trust you a world-class mission right now .
379	and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying is that steve levitt told you yesterday about how this expensive and hard to install car seats -- it &apos;s a waste of money .
2244	and then i realized , when he says , a farm that has no insections , it drives huge , because the water flows through this farm comes from the river of guadalquir .
4639	especially in the world today , in this intersection of new and old media and the fragmented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting medium tool that the masses bring this message .
5638	so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all together , are we just going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
6384	this is a state in which the heart fails , rather than pumping the entire blood further , becomes part of the blood in the lung , and fills that gradually , so the shorthern-heartedness occurs .
2629	but actually , this note is for the things that we companies that don &apos;t completely lead to the big reductions , just the same , or even slightly less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
5004	so i &apos;ve given another talk with facts that included a graph like this , which is trying to prove that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
6375	and i left the medical school with the impression that , if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , i could be as close to complete as possible that i was immune to making errors .
891	i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing it for a couple of years now with the biohacking , and i started that because i just wanted to know more deeply , and i wanted to do it in particular terms of what i &apos;ve learned in college .
3043	because the moment i turn my hand away from you , so you can see it from the back , this finger moves , my index finger , just from where it was , into a position where it was so extended .
1462	not to burn the sloth a little bit better , and to deposit it and to deposit it it and lose all the materials for cycles , but first of all , how do you sleep ?
1230	that means , i &apos;ve actually now spoiled them to the point that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern in it anymore , but i have condentied them within a very short period of time to see this dog in this versatified picture .
2535	in other services , like the manufacturing of fertilizers , 105 : 05 : 56,000 -- it &apos;s made ; 00 : 05 : 58,000 , or air traffic , or air traffic , is a lot smaller for improvement .
1280	and then if i go one step further into these natural user interfaces , where i have to , by voice , by language , by touch , by gesture , and not by mouse and cursor , i have to control things faster , and i &apos;m even more immediate .
4773	they allowed us to tell the story of neuromarketing , the way we tell the story in this movie , that you use mris today to pin the fungus of the brain , to make both ads and films .
2320	now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials , some of them come from science . some , even less , they come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the music area .
2561	we need solutions , either one or more , that have a unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliability , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for it , i really only see five that can afford these big demands .
6157	if you live in california , there &apos;s a popular decision in this spring that &apos;s going to be about trying to actually implement some of the money that otherwise flows to the politics of the punishment .
1148	that is , you &apos;ve found yourself by talking a common language , you &apos;ve been able to communicate with each other , you &apos;ve moved into the same cave , or other areas , you &apos;ve created cities , you know , or you &apos;ve created villages and you &apos;ve created some sort of tribal society .
3912	most women , like me -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosome structure , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually respond to androgens .
3596	if you allow someone to activate your own inner forces -- the human mind is so recommended -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment you open a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
4751	the first thing that i saw was this idea that their brand personality separate two , but there were passing sides -- the morgan spurlock-brand is an eight-hour brand .
3587	and dr. kean kept on saying , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they haven &apos;t been told anything else all the time , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you let children overcome themselves , then children can achieve a lot . &quot;
5714	some bacteria have figured out how to stay from penicillin and have put that information together with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
2380	something interesting happened in &quot; abyss &quot; : to solve a narrative problem in this movie -- and that was , we had to create some sort of liquid water creature -- we took it on computer-generated animation , cg , back .
444	when we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s like all the opportunities in modern molecular biology , and so we &apos;re going to turn to other mechanisms .
1120	and so , from the city , i get a very different view , a very different impression , which is that i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get a very different kind of virtual map of a very real city .
5343	and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a newcomer , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something that you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boat .
3773	now , let me introduce you to elegs , which is being carried by amanda boxtel , which , 19 years ago , had a spinal cord injury , which has come to the conclusion that they haven &apos;t been able to run for 19 years and so far .
4591	as i said , over the years , i kind of passed myself into some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could help me , anything that was as difficult and as dangerous as going into the room with these guys .
4039	and i want to say something that is a feminist , which is a little bit radical , and i think there might be different ways of thinking that governs different kinds of anatomy , especially when people are using a group thinking .
31	for example , take this child from barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the anakonda , believe that they were mythologically entering the milky river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
4942	we turned the lights off , put it in a vacuum , and sucked all the air out , and cooled it up until now , all the time , all the way up , was the piece of metal free to behave as it always wanted .
10	together , the countless cultures in the world form a net of spiritual and cultural life that envelopes the earth and is just as important for the earth as the biological food web that you know as a biosphere .
2892	but because that hasn &apos;t happened here , we can deny it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and deliver messages from fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live .
2498	the coal evolution pushed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century there was a rapid case in the electricity cycle , and so we have refrigerators , air conditioners , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
1189	we see this when i make things up , i can make them confusing like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what salt and pepper , or i can sort of make them intuitive by showing things .
5464	but this is the finest thing that can happen , because this is the straightforward , countless , to help patients , because this could be used against obesity , or it could deflect patients from smoking .
3057	because what it turns out is that if you offer placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an aspirin tablet , that &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect .
2279	operators that are not worlds for themselves , operators that are restoring instead of using , operators that are building sideways instead of just building intense , farmers that are not only producers , but experts on relationships .
4044	years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my students asked me , one of my students , who knew my interest in feminism -- i considered myself a feminist , and i still do -- a really strange question .
2345	and my nose always stuck in a book , a science fiction book that informed my thoughts into other worlds and , in telling me , my deep , untapped curiosity .
453	here &apos;s a footage of the molecule that we made by using these processes -- in fact , we just used hefe-mechanics with the right design of the pieces , we fit them in , and then we automatically assemble them .
2063	and in exactly one of these rounding rounds , nathaniel , when we started with our first teaching class in the walt disney conchall , and he had lost this irre flyer in his eyes and really completely lost .
3800	there was any lawyer or murder , who could now be the rest of his life , who could tell people that he went into a burning house to save a living thing , just because he was five seconds faster than me .
3890	the other hat that i &apos;ve carried at my work is the activist , as a patient lawyer -- or , as i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyer -- of people who are physicians &apos; patients .
4022	i want to say that i probably know some bright label dogs that are more capable of making more finder , more intelligent and richer decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40-year-old who i know .
3571	a few years ago , i was in the city where i grew up in a food market in this red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a junk of tomatoes .
6653	so these are the three major tandem groups : criminals doing it for money are hackers like anonymous who are resistant to it , but the last group are nations , governments who are running the attacks .
6673	and in this folder there were clips in germany , in germany , one company that the egyptian government had sold a couple of programs that they could -- in very large-scale interfaces -- all of the communication of the egyptian citizens .
3083	if you &apos;re evil -- if you can easily fall in your ear -- i showed this to some friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and this is a woman who has become nearly powerful .
88	but the thing about tryptamins is that they can &apos;t be taken into hydro because they &apos;re , of course , in the human supreme enzyme , named monoamine oxidase , denatrized by a human gut .
826	and when these tools become more physical and develop awareness for their movements , recognizing each other and perceive the intricacies of our transition , we can start to explore new and entertaining interactions with them .
3936	where i &apos;ve seen most exciting lately was the south african runner in caster semenya last year , whose gender was challenged in the world &apos;s chatlethik championship in berlin .
2045	the question is , quite simply , if you make yourself completely independent of any fossil or ancient energies that are drilled out somewhere in the world and you get to them , then you &apos;re an island .
5043	many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families back to work suicide -- sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough money to afford food and clothing .
24	what could be more lonely than being slandered by the silence , be one of the last of your people who speak your language , have no way to continue the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect the hope for children ?
3509	many ancient societies , including the greeks and the romans , really believed that the language of an aircraft has a great force , because what you &apos;re talking out loud can also manifest .
1217	then it goes back to the front , because the one on the back is not looking at the front , and says , well , look really , again , and sure if what you see is also what you want to see .
3524	but as the already quoted examples from synonymous dictionaries , let &apos;s not have a room to imagine what we all want : to allow each individual to see themselves as powerful people .
38	they threw shiny photos of themselves out of the air , which we would call a friendly assessment , and they forgot that these people from the rainforests in their life had never seen anything two-dimensional .
3435	they were leaving poetry and they were searching for a new home , and they were just leaving behind as many people as there was food to survive and looking for the rest of the neighborhood in which they could thrive .
3898	in one case , you might have somebody with a xy chromosome base , and the sry gene of the y chomosoms saves the protogonads we all have fetal stage to grow up .
3441	you may have actually saved your people through play by flipping into games for 18 years and then having this insight and learning so much about each other that they have saved the entire civilization .
5071	they had 250 different kinds of mustard and essig , and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and this was at a time when we actually drunk light water .
3223	anyone who &apos;s not separate from these terms is going to distort the study of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers about well-being that have been messed in the study of happiness for a long time in this particular way .
404	this is a map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , that has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do it with a smaller genome .
3355	so if you look at this interesting statistic that &apos;s recently been published by a researcher carnegie mellon university , the average young man from today in a country with strong game culture spends 10,000 hours with online games to the 21st year of life .
2657	bg : yeah . now you &apos;ve got to replenish the reactor all the time , so there &apos;s a lot of people and a lot of controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and get things out there . it &apos;s not good .
6495	we &apos;re working in a system where errors happen every day , where one out of 10 medications is either a wrong or wrong doctor , where hospital infections are becoming countless and countless and angry or dead cause .
2639	if we don &apos;t get that wish , the digging between the long term and the short-term thinking is going to be terrible between the united states and china , between poor and rich rural , and almost all of those two billion lives are going to be much worse .
733	this is a problem because global warming is looking at the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon , which , when it comes up , is exposed to microbes to methane .
3698	so , what that means is , if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and particularly as we look forward in the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
3527	so perhaps this technological change points out , because the fact that there has always been a different truth , which is that every human being in society can be something special and very powerful and that the human ability to adapt , is our biggest plus .
4511	what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of attacking was actually to let it happen slowly and unsecretly -- obviously in the attempt to despise warfare , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get there quickly .
3196	and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the memory itself , and you can think of the memory itself as one that sort of draws the living self through experiences that the life itself doesn &apos;t need .
90	now , what &apos;s fascinating is that the betakarboline contained in the liane are the mao-inhibitors of exactly the same way that &apos;s necessary to make the tryptamins possible , so ask yourself .
941	the first project that we did as an international group , when we sort of became aware of ourselves , o.k , there &apos;s us now as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are chatting and so on .
502	but , as we think , the only way that biology is going to have a huge impact without further increases in the cost of food or restriction from its availability is when we see co2 as an output material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go this way .
4514	i started working through scientific literature about how these centrifuge are built in natanz , and found out they &apos;re structured in what we call kaskades , and each cascade contains 164 centrifuge .
2584	so there are big challenges here , and there are challenges in transmission , for example , when we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they have to deal with the risk that the energy from where it comes from .
4314	i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then to draw with a laser pointer on it that only controls the negative area .
2529	in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably make a dispute and use less , but on average , that number will increase every year , and therefore more than doubling , the number of services that are provided every year .
4937	i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up , and i &apos;m listening to all these things because i don &apos;t want to admit them , or frankly , they &apos;re gone away .
6217	my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that becomes information technology is going to be big on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the price performance performance quotient is doubling every 12 to 24 months .
5705	and what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made up of normal letters that we use to symbolize -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve added it 10 or 22 times .
3605	they then passed over a three-month period of time students with a &quot; enough &quot; the note &quot; very well , &quot; and they were told they were very smart , and after those three months , they actually wrote down .
3522	and i &apos;m going to ask myself today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful , young girl shaped my self-image , and so i could think of myself as a nature of strong , powerful and breathic people .
4595	so what &apos;s going on in &quot; the greatest movie ever 1,000 is that everything from the top to the bottom , from the very beginning to the very end , is completely seen with brands -- from the front sponsor you &apos;re going to see in the movie , this is the brand x .
5460	and they &apos;re also being called off by my general doctor , so he can see where my weight problem is , not just in the moment that i need cardiology support or so , but also with a look at the past .
529	it &apos;s a picture of the first ray particle , which then put all the way back around the lhc , then colonized with a part of the lhc , to leverage the rain of particles on the detector .
2338	what if we could turn this situation and turn the internet on its head , so that instead of going from one to the other , we can start from many things to many things , and by looking at patterns that would have otherwise borrowed ?
2024	and the message is , we have to go to these rotating masses , if we sort of , like , 20 , twenty percent , twenty , 30 , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to achieve them at all .
2954	he killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beef , bone handle and lemon oil is much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know can implant the course of aids .
4956	that was worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , you know , check that , the massable difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
700	if a performer in spain has done something impossible , something magical -- our allah , olé , olé , allah , great , bravo -- it &apos;s intangible , it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
1926	and i stopped it all the way up to six and a half , and then , along with friends , i became a co-founding company solon , which then became one of the largest cell manufacturers in the world with the spoff q. cells .
1157	at the same time , it was a monkey , where adel , klerus and others said , you &apos;re actually crazy when the people start reading , they want to talk to you , and that &apos;s obviously totally fatal .
3672	i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single organisms , each cell divides , and all the genetic information from the cell is carried on in both deadly cells .
1390	that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no bio-agriculture , there &apos;s no bioland , there &apos;s no natural progression , and as they all say , that allow our own excrement to go back .
3583	he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk and would never be as moving as other kids or that you could never have an independent life , and since then they just punished me . &quot;
3498	but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s when i just started at elementary school , and started to build my self-image outside my family environment and form it in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
3582	and because i was born without a waking legs , and my feet were looking for them , and i only had a few toes on this one hand and a few toes on the other foot , he was the bridge , that stranger had to get the bad news .
6096	and finally , i think even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and so inspirational , and so stimulating , we &apos;re not actually measured by our technology , not the things that we &apos;re developing , not our intellect and our minds .
6148	the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i came here to say this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
592	and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start this dark path of suspicion sort of slowing down -- especially in the circumstance that i &apos;m in my career right now .
864	the last example that i &apos;ve got time to show you today is a music sequencer for live performing , which we &apos;ve recently developed , and in the sile as a sound , like the leadership voice , the barrel and the drums that we &apos;ve recently developed .
5027	immediately after this choice , between the 21st and the 24th of february , a delegation of about 30 dog people went to the two places in the world that were most interested in entering the city &apos;s business .
563	but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that , over 20 years ago , when i first told my teenagers that i wanted to be a writer , i had been confronted with the same kind of anxiety response .
1014	and this is very amazing , because in fact , you think that this technology that you &apos;re encountering is that it actually brings you into the future , but in fact , the future is right in us , in our archaic roots .
724	last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , which , for nearly three million years , had the size of the bottom 48 states , is shrunk by 40 percent .
3344	so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be at the edge of an epic victory that we prefer to spend all of our time in these worlds .
5971	in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles to philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black men are either in prison , in prison , on currency , or in direct punishment .
440	and we started creating pieces , starting with bridges that contain five to seven letter letters , added them together to make 24,000-letter pieces to assemble them together , up to 72,000 .
2201	later on the day , i was driving around this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
1306	imagination is more important than knowledge , and with that phrase , i &apos;d like to also close , a and give the clue again , designers need to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
3492	i was always in writing my synonymous dictionary , but i was already done with the process of the text , and it occurred to me that i &apos;ve never even proved in my life what the word &quot; impaired &quot; really .
39	they raised these photographs of the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , found nothing and concluded that these were the business cards of devil , and killed the five missionars with the spear .
1202	and then when i sit another halval on it , we don &apos;t see one more unit , which is circle , circle , and we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a different one .
1139	and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up because things are supposed to be more intuitive , more natural , more user-friendly , and you have to look at , you know , what &apos;s really , for humans , of course , what &apos;s user-friendly or intuitive .
566	don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re going to take this piece of your life and never get out of it , and that you &apos;re going to die on a rotthed dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of the blessing ?
3320	if we &apos;re in a game world , i think that many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and instantly helpful , are willing to solve the problem as long as it takes , to try it after the fail .
127	here &apos;s a photograph i took on the north end of the baffin islands , when i went to the narwhal jagd with inuits , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
6489	there &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- the ones that make errors and the ones that don &apos;t make them , the ones that constrains sleep and the ones that have no limitation , the ones with bad outcomes and the good results .
4108	i don &apos;t have to dress these things emotionally , because at the same time around the corner there will always be a different crazy , colorful , disruptive outfit that &apos;s just waiting for me if i have a little love in the heart and search for it .
5088	now , deciding not to buy a glass of markers is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our silence -- but it turns out that the decision overload problem affects us in very consequence decisions .
2985	it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t let science do its work , because we &apos;re afraid to have a real allegiance , and it holds millions of people from the flourishing .
308	so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less satisfaction with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
2572	it has three big problems too . the cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high , and the question for security that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human occupation that the fuel isn &apos;t used for weapons .
1174	and when , of course , is a little intuitive , and how do i , as a form , can i influence it , and then , according to the things that are so intuitive that they &apos;re a usage friendly , so they &apos;re intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun and easy to use .
4033	but when i telephoned him , and asked him why he made these surgeries -- they were very risky surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these kids were very bad at being treated , and so he had to do it .
6354	suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved person with clogged heart disease vessels , and your home doctor overwhelmingly has a cardiologist whose average accomplishment is 200 .
3812	both in my profession at robin hood and my side profession as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m witnessing generosity and kindness at a large scale , but i also see the actions of the closest love and the mut of individuals .
710	so i started thinking , and so i think with safety in the last few months , working on the book that will soon appear -- as the dangerous , scary , strongly anticipated successor of my previous success .
1133	i &apos;m from house , so of course , i &apos;m involved in the subject of curiosity , and how curiosity also changes the way we think , and why do we lose curiosity , and maybe we have to reject it , and so on and so forth .
1805	here you have this censor between the unconscious and the conscious who jumps right now , without the fact that you can do something about it , and the things you know that they look very different , so that they can sound much better for you and others .
4423	we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to hand , and i didn &apos;t do it , all the fences that i wanted to flip , all the experiences that i wanted to do and never did .
4172	so we started with a number of volunteers who , a little more than a year ago , helped in seattle to tag the things that they were throwing away -- different kinds of things , as you can see , things that they would throw away anyway .
2005	so this whole discussion of how this is going to go right now , and it &apos;s going to move , and energy turn , like this is supposed to be going on , on the island , for example , for five to 30 percent excess energy , so we &apos;re going to tire the wind and the sun .
3839	congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the place of a violent argument that has been devastated for decades and has almost taken as many lives as the first world war .
5328	tan le , anonymous inhabitant from footscray , was now tan , refugee and social activist who was invited to the talks that they had never heard about , and in homes that they could never have imagined before .
3262	and it turns out , under an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a major representative sample , under a 600,000 dollars a year .
1013	because i believe that the interactive media in us address archaic , cognitive models , so thinking patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very , very long time ago , and that we can actually start to call them through interactive media right now .
3549	it &apos;s more to me , perhaps , to make it clear that we don &apos;t have to overcome the widens necessarily , but that we &apos;re open to embracing them , to grab them on the shelf , to even use a fight expression , and maybe even dance with it .
1545	if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water vessels , inside , that you can actually go back to cell base on a baby in israel or in tunisia , you can plant 100 or 50 trees in tunisia .
3500	if i were to take this entry seriously , i would be born in a world that would perceive someone like me as a person whose life could not be anything positive in any way , but today i am celebrated for the odds and adventures i &apos;ve experienced .
648	so she runs up to the house , and she looks for the paper , and the poem goes through her , and she reaches a pencil just as she goes through it , and then she said -- she said -- it was like she was going to reach out with her other hand and grab it .
26	and i know some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; would the world be not a better place if we were all speaking only one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let this language be yoruba . let it be kanesian .
1140	and before the background , i &apos;ve been in the field of natural interface design , so the next generation in the orbit of human computers , where , in the context of the human computer , i &apos;ve been looking at how our tools , or how the computer is changing from the computer , from the computer , sucessive to the digital assistant .
61	after the ancient tyrannian civilization , which populated the caribbean coastal plain of colombia , and as a result of conquest , this people moved into an isolated volcanic massive , which goes beyond the caribbean coastal level .
4648	that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and bags , just to explore and look through , instantly understandable , characterized by visibility and access to information , specifically , in terms of business practices -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
4032	i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i spoke to a couple of years ago , who had brought a couple of siamesian twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
4042	what we &apos;ve learned from cross-cultural studies is that women , on average -- not each , but on average -- tend to give very complex social relationships and caring about people who are vulnerable within the group to giving a lot of attention .
234	and then you go to the consumer electronics store to assemble a stereo plant -- loudspeakers , cd-player , a tape player , radio , amplified . and in this one electronics business , there &apos;s so many stereo facilities .
2691	i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , when you think about the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that , if things come faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
1152	this was a huge hurry at the time , because , of course , you began to manifest the living language in the form of writing , which is what fluid and alive is , i start and i throw it in stone and i manipulate it .
4502	in order to set up these theories , we call ourselves to think that it &apos;s definitely a high-graded sabotage , it has to be a high-quality goal , and very likely it &apos;s in iran because most of the infections were reported there .
3962	i think they were so brave and strong , and so radical , in what they were doing , i found out every few years looking at the malignant musical musical music in 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s totally forgotten .
4984	they knew that every year , about 75,000 hondurans left their country to go out to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do the same thing in honduras .
898	and then there are things that have come totally in the day-to-day life , which most people don &apos;t realize , like washing enzymes that allow us to wash at 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically optimized enzymes .
2744	what kindergarten children do differently is they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have multiple times the opportunity to repair belly prototypes .
4021	i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in terms of people like that , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden retriever that probably deserves a lot more socially than some people i know .
3311	and this is what we have to see on millions of face of problem-solvers all over the world , when we take the barriers of the next century , the face of people who are on the edge of an epic victory .
147	we believe that polemics -- we believe that polemics is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , and our website has 35 million hits every month .
2420	in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before and the science at the time when we saw them , there were no words at all .
4116	now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and everybody in italy grows up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m going to show you this is because in the formula 1 , in the past decade , something very interesting happened .
5114	when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10 at the worst selling cat pitch , they found that the gains went up by 87 percent -- a result of both , the increase in sales and the reduction of cost .
2723	since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even ctos of fortune 50-corporations , and there &apos;s something about this task that makes deep impressions into the nature of collaboration , and i want to share with you some of them .
4331	we took a ps3 camera , we made it apart , put it on an led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we provide the code for free , you can download the software for free .
5510	so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year off and work in an environment that is pretty much everything that they actually hate , and we let them work in the government .
1182	and you can see that there &apos;s a , our seven senses , that most people think we have just five , already it &apos;s seven , that &apos;s probably going to be seven in the near future , that &apos;s going to be the next , assumed point , and as an extension of our self .
978	but that &apos;s what my prototype looks like , but it was pretty much driving out , so on a branch , that thing on top of it , was embedded with electronics , and it was pressure , but that was too high , that thing was broken .
1620	it was on a piano clash for music students in my beloved old teacher , professor jürgen ude , a well-known beethoven specialist , concert pianist and long-lived professor of music school here in stuttart .
5764	what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking machines are doing is , we think at a certain level of abstraction , we &apos;re missing this machine , and the machine is doing something that goes beyond our capabilities far better and faster than we could ever do .
2015	we look in this web , we see the 50 hertz , and when it turns out to be nine out ninety-nine hertz , we start making some valves , again , a little white merh steam goes in , we come back up again .
2849	so i also wrote an article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they thought that molecules were moving around in a particular way rather than a random way .
3569	there &apos;s evidence that already neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , older people and people have contributed to severe physical injuries , and this may have happened because the lifespan of these people is valuable for society .
5147	in which we did this simple thing , there was a increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was a increase in the number of people who were willing to save , or a increase in four percent in the amount that they were willing to pay for the savings account .
6172	now we have &quot; three-story &quot; laws that bring people behind bars all the time , for a bicycle theft , for the theft of good things , rather than forcing them to give back the sacrifices .
1273	and then the next one that &apos;s already been working with the newer neural model , or the mental model , like the software eergonoma , was that you would have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to use the computer .
939	and yeah , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively heterogeneous , so there &apos;s a stop of people doing the home alone , all the way to large , larger organizations , who are actually doing it more formal in institutional form .
3677	now , i have to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death of sex -- it seemed pretty sensible at the time , but every year , it came to my growing two .
3889	i &apos;m a trained historian , and in this case , i study how people went to anatomy -- meaning human body , animal body -- how they went around with body fluids , with body concepts ; how they thought about bodies .
2071	and like a miracle , he took his violin and he started playing after hearing some clips of violin concert certs and then asked me to end them : dolphin son , tschaikovi , sibelius .
2565	what you have to do there might just seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to capture all the co2 that comes out of the cockroach after you burn it , you have to get under pressure and then store it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
4311	i committed to the place and to his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to find a way that he can do his art again .
55	the spirits can be shaped from the great water , answers to the rhythm of the dance , to push the soul of the living past , so that the akolyth becomes a brief shiny moment for god .
966	so now , when i do that , the profilers go to the scene , they go to the scene , they accumulate any hair samples , and then they turn that method on , and then they can say , o.k , that hair belongs to this human being , like this .
689	because ... at the end , it &apos;s like that . centuries ago , in the desert north africa , people have gathered into month-like fests with sacred dances and music that have been held for hours -- to the dawn of dawn .
136	he contained the dog , and he improvised a dish , took the skeleton of the dog , and improvised a bad one , tended a different dog and switched over the ice cords with the fatalian knife on the belt .
2951	because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my field on mammography , &quot; or any cancer quacle salver who wants to treat his patients with caffle procedures .
3926	the reason kids with this kind of body -- whether it was dwarf or siamesian twins , whether it was intersexual -- surgeons are often adapted to the norm , is not because it would be advantageous for their physical health .
4241	the idea is , again , imagine that we reconcile the people to do something and to change the environment -- almost as we call it , to incorporate the cloud movement of how to move a scheme , but with a cloud .
4004	heinrich , since you assume that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you he &apos;s the xy -- because you assume he &apos;s male , he can now be pulled into what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
361	finally , a consequence of the purchasing of a bad sitting jeans when there &apos;s only one way to buy , is that if they &apos;re unsatisfied , and they wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could they have done ?
6054	&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed the most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be in hopeless places , and be witnesses . &quot;
6285	and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photo , libraries of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- are now literally being dematerialized and cheaper in your cell phone .
1106	i graduated , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the bacheloring work of michael burk , ann-kathrin krence , joris klause and janit-morller .
4008	and to me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science makes such progress in the area of anatomy that we have to get to a point where we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could collapse ?
5017	the leaders of the government in honduras would depend on the help of partnerships , they could benefit from their partnerships that they would support on the order of these charter and the progression that everybody can trust that the charter is actually being done .
3201	and when i think about it , i think of a vacation we made a couple of years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think quite often about it in relation to how often i think about other holidays .
2438	and maybe a little glimpse of what might happen in a couple of decades , if you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things , in all kinds of post-human futures futures that i think of as a science fiction fan .
3861	and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideal wealth where you bring new elements into the game -- like the testes -- and also how the game requires both trust and the play -- while also doing immensely fun at the same time .
5654	the reason for this is , if i were to draw it on a normal curve where , say , these are the years , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a popular measure of the technology that i want to do with a graph , then the graph albern .
2075	by playing music and talking about music , from this paranoid , confused man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , was a love worker , educated , skilled , trained musician in juilliard trained as an trained musician .
4050	so where the founding fathers were extremely suspicive to find out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we brought more mothers into this concept , we can get more of a concept from , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
4755	many companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- avoiding things they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to be afraid , these elements , and they &apos;re welcome , and they &apos;re actually turning them into something positive , and this is a historical chess .
4030	we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , as is in iran , where a man who feels sexually attracted to other men is punished with death , unless he &apos;s willing to sign himself to a gender transformation in which case he &apos;s allowed to stay alive .
6304	and they &apos;re going to be healthier by using the tricoder , and they &apos;re getting trained better by the khan academy , and by using the ability to use 3d printer and infinite computing , they &apos;re going to be much more productive than they &apos;ve ever been .
5106	the main reason for this is that we might enjoy looking at these giant shelves full of mayonaise , senf , essig and marking , but we can &apos;t actually drag the comparisons and sections and then actually choose something out of the awesome offer .
1100	so if you look at google glasses , for example , this is a concept of what makes us reconnect the virtual world with the real world , which means that our affinity to virtualization is to feel the virtual as something that is normal , natural .
5091	now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i did with gur huberman , eme kamenica , wei jang , where we set up the choices for the retirement of almost one million americans from about 650 places all over the united states .
4663	but there was only one company , an agency , ready to help us -- and only because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , and i had to deal with the middle-class guy and go right to the corporations with my team .
2346	this curiosity also showed that if i wasn &apos;t in school , i would travel through the forests , i would travel and see &quot; samples &quot; collected , frogs and snakes and beetles and dresses , brought everything home and under the microscope .
662	he was driving at high speed when he suddenly heard a little fragment of a melody , which is often very , very difficult for him in inspirations , and he wants to have them . she &apos;s gorgeous . he &apos;s jolly after that , but he can &apos;t grab them .
3916	another example : a couple of years ago , i received a call from a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , who had a friend , had sex with his friend , lived as a man , and he had just found out he had chicken and a utero mother .
4578	in fact , i &apos;ve been putting the biggest part of my career in the sink of terrible situations , and that &apos;s all for the attempt to investigate society in such a way that they &apos;re engaging and interesting and interesting , and hopefully , in a way , to understand what makes them fun and accessible to the audience .
660	we talked about this issue . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the embodied modern artist who tried to master this uncontrollable , creative impulse that lived in him , and to deal with them .
3206	now , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the ears of memories , but even if you do more of them , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight over the course of the weight that we give experience ?
645	it ran like the devil to the house as it was pursued by this poem , and it was only about it that it had to get quickly enough to get to a sheet of paper and a pencil , so that if it was peeled through it , it could be captured and held on the sheet .
6432	the next couple of weeks i made suggestions , and i first found myself the non-healthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
11	you can think of this cultural web of life as a ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be defined as the sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations and intuitions that have been defined by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
3939	we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t drag a line between male and female female or female and intergender and female and female and intergender and intergender ; we are actually the one that prevents this separation line as natural .
4583	so what you got was this : your name presented here : my tedtalk that you have no idea what the subject is going to be , and that you could actually fly around the ears at the end of the day , especially if i put your company in dumm in there .
126	and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility of being what we are : people with full consciousness , who have the importance of recognizing that all people and gardens can be thrived in a space , and there are great moments of optimism .
6015	these older people are now coming to me and saying , &quot; mr , stevenson , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re giving talks . they &apos;re telling people that they &apos;re supposed to stop saying , for the first time , we have to do it in the history of our nation with terrorism , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
2566	there are some mushrooms that are creating this at a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult for 100 percent to get it . and to create an impact on the charge of the co2 , it &apos;s a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the storage question .
4230	we worked with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the étoile at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in mailand -- we recorded his movements in 3d to use them as a impulse for the flyfire .
3018	i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect for some time . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because , you look at it as i , &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be something to happen if somebody believes in it hard enough . &quot;
2062	now , as a result , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases , and they &apos;re so bad at times , and he &apos;s wasting for days , going around in the streets of skid row , always exposed to this horror and the torture torture of his own mind .
43	we were following the geneaology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we were asking people about the pressure , they were admitting that one of the people had become so old that he died from his age , and we were killing him with the spear .
3105	the people in the back or the one that you see on the video later , will say , &quot; well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would be -- look , there &apos;s a hole there , and there , if it was really real , it would be flowers . &quot;
5118	now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that have just recently come to market , about how the best way you can make the choice is something that david laibson has very strongly comprised , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
5469	at this point , the patients come in . they can &apos;t just take control over again , be captain on their own ship , but they can also help us in health care of the challenges that are ahead of us , and the cost of health care , double-demand demand , and so on .
5001	so the tedtalk was in very simple form that a charter city is a place whose initial country is uninhabited , a founding contract that determines the laws that exist there , and the people are able to decide whether to live under those rules or not .
6418	about an hour after she got home , after i sent her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 , and the rescue assistant brought her back to the emergency room with a 50 blood pressure , which is a dangerous shock condition .
4532	now , what this thing does is it captures the ingenious values of sensors -- so , for example , printing sensors and vibrating sensors -- and it provides legitimate code that &apos;s still running during the reef , with some wrinkling data .
5296	but i remember the lights of the oil platform before the malaean coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple that gave me one of the men on the platform .
3048	and now you could talk about why this is an illusion , why you don &apos;t perceive that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it processes information doesn &apos;t count it , one , two , three , but you see it as a group .
91	how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of adstrinous plants find these two morphologically unrelated plants that , when combined in this way , create a kind of biochemical version so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
5518	here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody who &apos;s releasing him when he &apos;s interrupted , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at branding when he &apos;s covered by a meter of snow .
3139	and then there &apos;s a memory self , and the memory of itself is the one that counts with us and perpetuates the history of our life , and it &apos;s the one who speaks to the doctor by asking the question , &quot; how have you felt lately ? &quot;
2637	if you just allowed me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is halved energy input without co2 , i would find that wish .
406	but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very straightforward , compared to ours , trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
334	and there was a time when there was only jeans in a way , and they bought them , and they paid bad , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they had long enough , and they would have washed enough , they would start feeling , &quot; ok . &quot;
5734	now this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years were needed before that , because this information had to be evolutionarily learned from the individuals who died because of this fruit , because these information processing structures were still not there .
5687	i also think there are theories that have begun to understand how it all started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story about it , which is that at that time , little oil spills were flipping around , which contains different kinds of recipes for chemicals .
1068	and these sounds and these rhythms have shown the geology , the topography of an area , and that has , of course , enabled you to defragment these songs and put them differently and so on the left , to the right and to the exit again .
5606	how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we reject ourselves , and we expect the government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then we haven &apos;t changed much ?
2460	you do it in order to do it , in order to solve the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that we have . you make it the most exploration way , and because of the strange connection that comes from when a small group of people form a team .
3167	now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually extend the reflection of patient a by just letting the tube in there without letting it go too much .
3169	and if you do that for a few minutes , you have proved that the living self from patient a is worse at it , and you have made the sense that the memory of the patient a is much better at it , because now you &apos;ve given patient a a better story about his experience .
2447	i took them with them , and i amidated them access to the world down there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so they could look around , samples and test instruments and so on .
65	and all this time , they &apos;re culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- equilibrium .
2332	and when i look again at a step and look at everything , i can rearrange my trajectory maybe after my search past . here , i &apos;ve looked for &apos; nepotistic &apos; , here after bing , or back to live labs .
302	you know , it &apos;s not just means that people have to eat dog food when they go into retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions so hard that they miss large investments from their employers .
1565	that , as a translator , not just a word for word , you have to transfer the text into a different language , but you have to understand the deeper sense of words and wortzusm slope in order to have a meaningful translation , everybody who has to do it with foreign languages .
2248	so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success in the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a water treatment plant , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
3640	the great genetics in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicator in the russian orthodoxen church , wrote a paper that said , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense of it except in evolution . &quot;
3697	on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are thermophil , and in doing so , the hot steam will survive the other way , if there were fish there , it would be vacuum fish to the next , but they managed to make a habitable environment there .
3732	what if you could change the sperm and the iron cells or the frozen fertilized egg to give your children a better chance for a healthier life -- elimination of diabetes , does the hemophily decrease the risk of cancer ?
108	you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people is generally convicted , but the ethnicide , the destruction of the way people live , is not just convicted , but generally , and in many ways , is celebrated as part of a development strategy .
6605	there are , for example , the anecdote that the report of a captain soundso that observed big fish occurrence in this area can &apos;t be used , or fishermen &apos; fishermen wouldn &apos;t usually be valued because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
3517	i had to repeat individual practice indefinitely with these thick , elastic bells -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles . and i &apos;ve hated these benches more than anything else . i hated them . i &apos;ve curled them . i &apos;ve cursed them . i hated them .
427	but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it had over 580,000 letters of genetic code , so we thought we could build it in tapes from the size of the virus where we could variate the size of the tape tapes to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
6275	and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of the do it , i want to share with you something -- he gave me the permission -- his technology called slingshot , and many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator in the dorm .
6228	&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; something my friends at autodesk &quot; infinite-computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that make it possible to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuels , vaccines and food , digital medicine , nano-materials and artificial intelligence .
59	look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo akolyst in a trcecondition , the glowing coal , without combustion , an amazing demonstration of the ability to affect the body in such a way that it prevents when it &apos;s placed in a state of extreme arousal .
2433	this was the most surreal form of a déjand vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i drilled around a corner at a time , i always knew what was going to appear in the light cone of the vehicle , because i had walked over-film set for months when we turned the film .
933	and s o with this premise with this premise , for example , brian degger in england tried to assemble a minimum abor , then he took a pressure caps , a heated plate , and , yes , so supplements , and then grew bacteria , worked .
3645	in this picture , i put a bush as a center of despair in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the species on the tips of these branches have been successful in evolutionary terms : they survived ; it has demonstrated fitness and strength in its environment .
942	and then just came from the do-it-yourself bio org website of the founder , and said o.k , we have to meet now , really , real , and then have organized two events , one in london , two thousand , and a half thousand in the united states , in san francisco .
924	a group from ankara , which i met a little while ago , which is a group of students who really wanted to convey the public more what they &apos;re learning in college , and they did so on street disorders and tried to explain to people what d.n.a is .
2517	this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people , from the services that every human on average , the average , the average energy for every service and the co2 that &apos;s emitted per unit of energy .
5018	and the insight from president lobo was that the certainty of the translation that i &apos;ve thought about was a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city could be equally significant for all parties in honduras , which have been under fear and mistrust for many years .
3496	i read this list to a friend of mine , and i had to laugh for the first time , it was so ridiculous , but i just came up to &quot; stop , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t talk anymore , and i had to stop reading , and i had to collect myself after this over-like word tide and the interconnecteous emotional shock .
368	i think a significant one -- not the only one , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disappointment because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain those experiences , think it &apos;s your fault .
5224	it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s looking to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday forward . gettin down down on friday . you didn &apos;t think we &apos;d have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
954	this really works , this is done in the academic setting , and then we thought , okay , so maybe we can do that , and then we took a webcam that would be screwed up , turn the lens around , and then you have a microscope that would scale up about a hundred times .
122	the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment , we underwent the cult of the seed corn , which set the poetry of the cockroach through the prose of the priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and shooting -- was only 10,000 years ago .
953	this is , if you focus a laser beam on one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the fluid , and then you can move it into this focus , so it &apos;s captured there , like a tractor beam , basically .
5153	if i show you 600 magazines and i split them into 10 categories , or i show you 400 magazines , and i split them up in 20 categories , then you think i &apos;ve given you more choice and a better choice than i had given you the 400 papers , if i had given you the 600 .
3567	it would be great if we could actually change this pattern of normality versus another set of opportunities , or the strength , to even make it a little more dangerous , to exchange it a little bit more dangerous , so we can unleash the forces of very many children , and invite them to put their very special and precious skills into society .
2653	bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need a couple of 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works reasonably , you &apos;re only in the 1000s million .
3178	i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calculated this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds . what it means is , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a lifetime . in one month , there are about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any trace .
1308	the first one , when you grow up as a child , as a baby , is that you take care of what failures you have like , right ? and the after your parents allowed you to play more or less in the sounds , the more you have , the more , you know , your curiosity , of course , is wobbling .
232	there are 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different extra olive ovals and 12 balsamicogenous that you could buy to make a huge number of your own salad of dessings in the improbable case that none of the 175 in the store is right for you .
1925	and that was really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , this is where i started going .
152	what i &apos;m going to show you , first of all , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve done microsoft as part of an exception just one year ago , which is seadragon . and it &apos;s an environment where you can either be locally or far away with huge amounts of visual data .
4185	my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you a lot more about the true and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk about the second part that we discussed in the beginning , and that &apos;s the emphasis of our environment .
935	so i tried to do this in my lab in my home , and then i bought some second-hand second-hand equipment on ebay , and i did some d.n.a analysis , and then i tried to do a father &apos;s test , which is this / d.n.a fingerprinting , which is to go back home .
6626	but if today , in 2011 , you buy a new color laser printer from the leading laser printing fabric and print a page , this page has actually printed light spots on each side , in a pattern that &apos;s clearly letting the page back on you and your printer .
4137	you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it means he took the hammer at the end and he threw it on moses -- you can still see a little bit of an untender -- and said , &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you speak ? &quot;
100	now , the problem is , even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of the native , look at them as orginian and colorful , but somehow they &apos;re limited to the past , while the real world , that is , our world , is continuing .
70	every time we think about the locals and the landscape , we would either turn up rousseau and the old framework of the noblen wild , which in its simplification is a racist thought , or on the other hand , thoreau , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
3210	and if you were to choose another vacation club , there is a conflict between your two species of self and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , you get an answer , and if you think in the sense of memory , you could get a different answer .
4143	and what we &apos;ve done is actually used a new kind of network , which was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and using anonymous and aggregated information from this network , which is collected from the operator to understand how the city works .
3542	in our desire to protect the people we care about , and to tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognotions , or even to provide a prediction for quality of life that they expect , we need to make sure that we don &apos;t put the basis that somebody &apos;s actually disabled .
1779	because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , descending from the highest creatures , not from such a natural level , from something unpredictable like an organism that exists yet , a rock comparable and other things , that &apos;s unsustainable to us .
5192	i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that limit the problem of decision-making -- narrowing -- will concrete the over-fluid alternatives ; concrete -- make it real ; categorize -- we can better deal with more categories , less possibilities ; we can prepare for complexity .
2059	he spoke in a very healthier and healthy clay about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and he talked about how the dodgers would never get into the baseball world series , and that &apos;s all due to the bridge of the first violin in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
620	and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was , let &apos;s put the human individual at the center of the universe -- about all the gods and mysteries . and there &apos;s no room for mystic creatures that take the commands from the divine .
586	but we don &apos;t even listen to somebody saying that , because we &apos;ve known this kind of statement for so long . somehow we &apos;ve embraced the perception so much , and collectively accepted that creativity and suffering somehow belong together , and that art , at the end , always leads to the soul qual .
5333	i wanted to go back to the routine and the quality of the life of an unknown precedent -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who have been closed every day in their days , and for 20 years , by telling each other the stories of their day , and sleeping , we still have three of them in the same bed .
1968	and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70 to ninety-nine percent renewable , and then we have this rest , the last , the last 10 , twenty percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you make it out of batteries .
907	and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a problem in progress , which is how things simplify , so any problem , you can throw up a question , and how can you do it differently , or how can you do it better .
1974	and they &apos;ve simulated the wind and the sun and the load , and they came to the conclusion , a very exciting conclusion that , over the conventional system , which , after twenty years , takes a middle-stroke of about 50 cents a kilowatt-hour , about 40 cents .
3519	and one day he looked at me at one of my practices -- these practices were just tired and nadenless -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you will one day shatter one of those benches .
5112	but in fact , we &apos;re seeing more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to limit , and the unimportant equilibrium opportunities are going to get rid of , well , then there &apos;s a increase in the sales , there &apos;s a cost of the cost , r &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement in decision-making .
52	a continent is always left out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa there was no religious faith . of course , there was one , and voodoo is simply the remaining of this very deep religious thought that came across during the tragic diaspora of slavery time .
2264	more of the cereal crops of herbivores , pest battlements on monocultures , chemicals on earth , chicken on fish , and all the time the agriculture industry just asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how horrible can that be ? &quot;
675	but the process and the heavy adhesive that surrounds it was raised when he took the genius out of it , where he had nothing but anger , and then left him where he came from , in a way , and he realized that it had no inherent , agonizing thing .
557	this strange event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called our eat , pray , love waves -- that , unlike all of my previous books , for some reason , went out into the world and became a big mega-event , international bestseller thing .
5561	and that &apos;s when you have all your feelings about politics and the snake at work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , is government , at the heart , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; what we &apos;re doing together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
4772	but , 17 brands partners who were willing to get rid of this control , who wanted to do business with someone , was eight and perpetual as i did , and eventually made us tell stories that we couldn &apos;t usually have told -- stories that a worker would never support .
2604	but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you &apos;ve never been able to simulate it reasonably , whether it would work , but ever since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right material approach , it looks like it &apos;s working .
3296	this may first seem a little denious , so i repeat it so that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , to the end of the next decade .
2269	not through recent mice and tractor inventions , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through chainsaws , but through forests , and not through fishing boats and nets , but through fish in the sea .
1372	and where you see how far we &apos;ve gone from that , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we &apos;re even on earth , you can see , for example , that openbach has a program , until twenty-four , you want to be climate-speaking , right ?
1160	with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what bangs on the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the lasagne horse flesh and no more cattle flesh or other phenomena , i just want to scream that out , and i want to do that at all .
6493	in my about 20 years of the medical sensation of consciousness and journalism , i created a personal medical trial on medical errors and wrong treatments so i could learn anything for the first article i did for the toronto star on my show , &quot; white coat , black art . &quot;
3806	now , not exactly what i hoped i &apos;d hoped , but i went out -- the stairs up , the hallway , past to the real &quot; fireman , &quot; which at the time had already been quite done in the bedroom to bring a pair of shoes .
2563	these may be a modern contribution , and if they do better than i expect it would be great , but my point here is that we have to work on all these five of them , and we can &apos;t give any of them up because they shy us , because all of them have significant problems .
646	in other paintings , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and the poem rolled through them , and she missed it . she said it would continue to move across land and -- as she said -- looking for another poet , looking for a different poet .
4765	up-attribute are things that are playful , fresh prince , time-consumed , adventurous , outlanded and loving like erol flynn , wasteful and agile , professional , glorious , magical and mystic like gandalf .
2502	they accumulate the sophisticated co2 that leads to temperature elevation , and that temperature elevation has some very negative implications , and effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indirect implication that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to such rapid changes , and so the whole systems collapse .
913	these are more artistic directions , so there are a lot of artists and philosophers and people working with scientists to try to interfere with these technologies and ask questions , and to process creatively , there are museum exhibitions , and yes , all kinds of things .
3641	now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to turn off your listening device , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book , which is to be wrong , because nothing else will make any sense for you .
3724	a few years ago , the laser prize , scientist shinya yamanaka , was awarded for his research in which he took home a grown-up adult , a fibroids , and through the manipulation of just four genes that developed the cell to bring them back to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell potentially is able to become your body &apos;s favorite cell .
2586	and to show the dimension , i looked at all kinds of batteries that are made , the ones for cars , computers , cell phones , flashlights , for everything , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , and what i &apos;ve found is that all the batteries that we can now produce less than 10 minutes of total energy .
3666	now let &apos;s take a step back to the age of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signal of living things , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-cellular organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , which eventually forms in the last 130,000 years .
188	this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre dame , who had just taken place in the computer with photographs of flickr , and just give them notre dame in flickr , and they &apos;re getting pictures of men in t-shirts and in the university site and so on , and so on , each of these orange clubs represents a picture that &apos;s been found when this model was heard .
186	i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on the summer to show you what i think is really the punch behind this technology , the photosynth-technology technology , and this is not so obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
1923	when one said no , the vetoprincep , it completely crashed you , i &apos;ve spent 10 years trying hard to tell you if i could actually turn my great engineering to a very poor thing , because all my father &apos;s colleagues have always listened to him , you have taken the money out of the window in your child .
3019	in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in some studies , the placebo effect , which is just because the person thinks what happens to them , whether it &apos;s a pharmaceutical , or a kind of -- in pain management , for example , if the patient is only strong enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
110	i once traveled with a young colleague of 6,000 miles from chengdu in west china through southeast tibet to lhasa , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics that you &apos;re hearing about : 6,000 sacred monuments that have been turned into shock and ashes , 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution by the kings .
465	we cleaned up the chromosome of a micro-species . roughly , they &apos;re the two from each other as far as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to try and select this chromosome . we deployed it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was quite amazing when we put it in a cell -- and they &apos;re going to appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .
120	margaret mead , who said the great anthropologist before she died , is that her greatest fear is that as we move towards a threatening , gridless , generic view of the world , we would not only see the whole range of human imagination in an engraved way of thinking , but that someday we would wake up from a dream , and have forgotten that there were ever other possibilities .
2699	and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems to invest in something that you only have later -- and then you get the investment not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report isn &apos;t necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world looking at ipcc and saying , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
6036	and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re digging people -- here &apos;s the risk of being condemned to death , elf times higher when the victim is white , than when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , if the folded black , and the victim is white -- in the same states where the body is right in which the yellow people rest .
74	it means that a little child is out of the andes that grows in the belief that the mountain is an apu-mind that determines his or her destiny will become a very different person , and will have a different relationship with this resource or this place , as a little kid in montana who grows up in the belief that a mountain is a pile of stones that can be worn off .
640	i had this encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who is now over 90 , but her entire life was deadly . she told me that when she grew up in the villages of virginia , she grew up on the fields outside , she said she felt and could hear how poem came across the landscape .
6644	these people have come online to wealth , but they have made it illegal by using trojans , for example , to steal money from our bank accounts , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or also keyloggers who collected our credit card information on the input of the keyboard , while we &apos;re buying an infected computer online .
5640	i usually have my role in explaining to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming up are going to be , and i thought , since i &apos;m here among my friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also trying to look back and see what &apos;s really going on here , with these incredible jumps forward , which is so quickly that we can &apos;t help .
2702	and that would be their answer to the björn lomborg argument , that if you use all that time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer from that , the decrease , decrease malaria , and so on , there &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money on it , while there &apos;s better things we can do .
78	this made me think of another person as my friends under the kwakiutl who believe that these forests are the place of hukuk and the curved sky cord and the cannibali geisters who live in the northern part of the world , spirits that they would participate in their matching initiation .
6060	woman parks came back to montgomery , where she had two of her oldest friends , these elderly women , johnnie carr , who had organized the montgomery-busy boykott -- an incredible african-american woman -- and virginia durr , a white , whose husband , clifford durr , dr. king demat .
970	and they have laid down so two builders and said , &quot; o.k , we &apos;re doing this simpler and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve just made it out of the open source , which is free hardware , electronics , all of this stuff , built up this device , and now they &apos;ve actually taken it to market shelves , and now the cheapest supply providers in the world are the cheaps .
909	and now , in addition to biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a science of information , because , the d.n.a code is an abstract code , which is , yes , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s more dynamic because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s real matter , and not just cyber .
3723	a week ago , the national academy of engineering , shifted the draper prize for francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who , however , evolved from each other , that encouraged the natural process of evolution to work faster , and to have desired proteins in an efficient way -- that frances arnold calls &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
1079	bruce brown , a well-known design researcher at the brighton university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , he says the book and the picture , not the television , the internet and so on , and so on , what we call mass media today is that these mass media of our memories have fossilized and our ability to virtualize .
3521	this , of course , was just a simple trick from dr. p. so that i would do the exercises that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect that i could be the richest five-year-old in the hospital ward in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily training horror with new eyes , so it became a new and promising experience .
603	while i &apos;ve been looking for models over the last year to do this , i &apos;ve also chosen to do this in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have had better or more rational ideas about how we can help to deal with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
3940	so we have this situation where , the further our science continues , we have to get into so much more , that these categories that we thought were robust anatomic categories , which made very simple arrangements to create permanent identities , much less trouble than we thought .
6322	and when these individuals came and looked at who is the best protein folder in the world , this was not a mit professor , it was not a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working in the daily days of the business guidance at a reha-clinic and at night was the world &apos;s best protein assistant .
3529	this set of convergence with widritedness lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on trying to solve a challenge without being coined by it , as though my life would have been so successful , because i &apos;ve been able to avoid the possible falling of a life with a prosthetic , or as well as people have perceived me with my disability .
4582	in fact , some happy people and companies , for-profit and nonprofit , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never let that back -- buy the name rights on the talk that you &apos;re seeing right now that no title has had a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence of what the subject would actually be .
2683	and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about it is that an uranium molecule has a million times the amount of energy that we say , a coal-fired molecule , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mostly the rays , the footprint and the cost , the cost , is the potential , so the impact on the land and other things , almost in one of their own league .
46	in the early &apos; 800s , i got a really amazing job when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to haiti and filming the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier and tonton macoutes , and the poison that was used to make zombies secure .
4319	so i went home , and i ate with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use his eyes to control things , we should find a way that tempt can control a laser , so that he can do graffiti again , that would be great . &quot;
3528	the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell me about how to deal with widrives , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence has never adapted to me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with answering people &apos;s questions , and i think gradually i understand why .
1298	and if i now compile that , for example , in which i directed as being overview , selected as a choice , informed in the trap , it &apos;s big for me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , transformed , i can actually flip it somewhere , or send someone in , and so on .
2056	i recommend you all to read steves &apos;s book , or to watch the movie , so you can &apos;t just understand the magnificent interconnectedness that came from these two men , but also how the music made that connection , and how it was ultimately the instrument , if that wordgame was allowed , to get the mithalf , nathaniel away from the street .
937	and in the bottom of this picture , you can see the laboratory , in leadership strikes , so this is a organized garage , with all sorts of lab scaffolds that the university has done , a group in paris that has done something to do , and it &apos;s pretty successful , and also quite interesting things , i want to do a project for a second .
1265	and then , in part , if you look at the software that we just saw , you look at it , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety-nine percent of our software today is not intuitive or unintuitive in the name of the i-pad , the i-pad in many areas or i-phone phones accorded , although it &apos;s already significantly more intuitive than classic software .
183	the computer vision algorithms have found these pictures together to allow them to actually synthesize the real space in which these pictures , all around the grassi lakes have been displayed in the canadian rockies , and you can see elements of stabilized dias or panoramic imaging , and these things have been held in relation to each other in spatial terms .
2666	bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet set us in a place , and there are a lot of interesting openings rules for everything called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s a lot of interest and the people in the company were in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been here and met the energy minister and talked about how this fits the energy agenda .
15	no biologist , for example , would claim to you that 50 percent or more of all species are just about to die because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the most apocalyptic case in the area of biodiversity -- is almost equivalent to what we know as the most optimistic case in the field of cultural diversity .
260	the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in the burden of responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something -- namely the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is probably ill , and therefore it &apos;s not in the best constitution to make a decision -- namely , the patient .
1996	we also have one of these same p.r. aggregate in the same size that he &apos;s got there , actually , in order to get the full dynamic behavior of this network , so in the halle now it looks like this , there &apos;s the back here , here &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the whole surrogate that we &apos;re simulating the web .
678	this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the typewriter , pray , love galaxy , and i fell into one of the scriptures of the doubt that we all fall to when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking it &apos;s a disaster . this is the worst book ever written .
2284	if i want to bring you to one thing today , the collection of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information translation , i want you to think about how we can use information to create patterns and we recognize trends that otherwise wouldn &apos;t be visible .
612	they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine thing that was believed that it was literally living in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio -- sort of like dobby , the house elf -- that came out , and the artist , in the work , was sort of invisible , and that the result of the work would make .
5144	so we did in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro giltero , we did a study with the people at ed -- employees who all worked for ing -- and these people were all in a gathering where they collected their participation on their rental plan .
101	so , the fact is that in the 20th century , 300 years , you will remember not remind for its wars or technological innovations , but rather than an era in which we were against , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth either actively supported or passive acceptance , so the problem is not the change .
2065	i was afraid , not opinion , but i was afraid that i could lose it , that he could fall into one of his conditions , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin , if i started talking about audiences and arpeggios and other exciting forms of the didactic self-assembly .
1908	i &apos;m probably hearing , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s been looking for this bad auko image , because i &apos;ve already started studying ninety-100-plus ninety-some machine building in karlsrudence , technical college , now it &apos;s called , i think , kit .
4119	now today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this one -- something that overwakes the car in real time , has a couple of thousands of sensors , the information from the car , passing that information to the system and then processing it , and then use it to send back this car and change things in real time as information accumulates .
699	interesting historical footnote : when the moars conquered southern spain , they brought this practice with them . the language changed over the centuries from napallah , allah , allah , diamé , olé , olé , olé , olé , olé , you can still hear about treating and flamenco dances .
2395	i had written this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; which was supposed to shoot the bar in things that were visual effects and computer-generated effects all over new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that were made using the cg , and the main figures were all cg , and the world should be cg .
3191	it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , say , had two levels of representation in two different surgeons and decides what to vote , then the one who votes the one who has the memory , which is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who is chosen .
0	you know , one of the great commons in traveling , and one of the pleasures in ethnography research is to live together with the people who can still remember the old days , who still feel their past in the wind , they touch from the rain curved rocks , they taste them in the bitter leaves of the plants .
6433	you all know the healthy shame when you have a secret to the best friend &apos;s prize , even though that one is bound to weigh , and then you get caught , and the best friend confronts you with it , and gives you a terrible argument when you end up causing a bad conscience at the end , and you vow that you never make a mistake again .
5571	if you ever have a chance to work in your urban call center like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , they &apos;re all doing that -- you &apos;ll see that the people who call the government for many different problems , including that there &apos;s a thylacine in your house .
2701	but my dream here is that if you can make it economic and eliminate the co2 , then the skeptics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it emitting co2 , i would almost wish it did , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
3129	now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures , which was a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and at the end of the recording there was a terrible circle of sound .
624	you know ? i think it &apos;s possible to allow a mere person to think that he thinks he or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the basin and the essence and the source of all the divine , creative , unknown , infinite mysteries is a little bit of a responsibility to acquire them to a fragile , human psyche .
1418	and what &apos;s really nice about this is , when you do this , you know , agriculture , you create biogas , in a hectare country that has five thousand people in favelas , so that a farmer can grow about a thousand-thousand-dollar farm , and they &apos;re waiting for it , chickens and pigs and pigs and vegetables and fish .
6485	if i was going to go into a room full of colleagues and ask for their instant support and start telling them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would very likely not reach the end of the second story before they really would get uncomfortable , anybody would have a joke , they would change the subject and forget the rest .
5430	so by adding color , contrast and hellity to the edges , to add in the individual images , to add photography , like depth , degraded colors and disorders , we wipe the boundaries between the different images and let them look like a single photo , even though a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
2836	we &apos;re at the threshold of astonishing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think we have to go back hundreds and hundreds of , 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time in which we have begun progress , where we have triggered over these things much , much more fronted than now .
106	and wherever you look around the world , you will discover that these cultures are not denied to the awak . these are dynamic living peoples whose existence is denied by cognitive forces that are going to go beyond their capacity of adaptation , whether it &apos;s the result of the enormous deforestation in the hot country of penan , a nomadiac people from southeast asia , from sarawak , a people who have been freely dumped in a forest , and where they are now devastated with the viation of the viation of the whisper , where they are , where the marininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininino is , where , where , where , where they are , where they
3459	the oil scarcity is invented , but we &apos;ve got plenty of online content to make it realistic for you , and you &apos;re actually living without oil . so , if you go to the game , you tell us where you live , and then you get news movies in real time that show you how much oil costs , what doesn &apos;t exist , how food supply is impaired , how transportation is being affected , whether there are schools locked up , and if you have to find out what it would be like to do , whether you &apos;re blogging to make pictures , or whether you &apos;re trying to make pictures about it .
82	what ayahuasca is so fascinating is not just the pharmacology potential of this preparate , but it &apos;s made out of two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane , which is a series of betakarboline , harmin , harmolin , slightly hallucinogeneous , it bursts . this plant is about to take on its own as if there &apos;s a blue tear on its consciousness , but it &apos;s made out of a threatening out of the coffee of the beaches of a , but it &apos;s made out of the beached with a beaver bean tree .
1	just knowing that jaguar schamanes are still traveling beyond the milky way or the importance of the myths of the oldest of the inuit is still full of meaning , or that in the himalayas , the buddhimalayans still follow the breath of the dharma is the central revelation of anthropology , the idea that the world in which we live in is not in an absolute sense , but only a model of the reality that we have as a consequence of the many generations of adaptation , is successful at the same time .
5270	how can i talk in 10 minutes about the interconnectedness between women over three generations , and how the astonishing power of this connectedness emerged in the life of a four-year-old girl when she , over 30 years ago , with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother , five days and nights , gled together in a little boat in the chinese ocean for 10 minutes . a connectedness that came to life in this little girl &apos;s life and never disappeared -- now , this little girl in san francisco and now , will live in front of you today ?
7	it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the penan forests in borneo forests , or the voodoo akolyst in haiti , or the warrior in the kaisut-desert of northern kenya , the curanderos in the andes , or a caravan in the middle of the sahara . this is the one time that i traveled to the desert a month ago , or even an acute shepherd hanging on the qaema , the world of god , the world of everest .
3526	of course , from the medical point of view , you can say that my legs , the laser surgical surgery for visually impaired , knee joints of titan and artificial hip joints for age-aged bodies that allow people to really use all their ways , and to look beyond the limits that their natural destiny has given them , not to speak at all about social networking platforms , can allow people to define themselves in their own way , and to look for the groups of the world in which they behave .

550	i &apos;m going to leave my closing words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who , like me , is when he defended the useless experiments of his teaching teacher , his teacher was michael faraday , what he said was , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind as to assume that our scientific ideas are valid , that there are no mysteries in nature that our triumphy are full and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
150	and what we do is we create a series of trips to the ethnosphere where we take our audiences to places like this cultural wonders , that they will be guided by the blessed , and hopefully , one by one , they will take on the other , the central epiphany of the anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in different ways that we can find a way of truly multicalistic world , where the wisdom of all of our common well-being can contribute to all of us .
66	at the end of this amazing initiation , they will one day be taken out and for the first time in their life , in the age of 18 , you &apos;ll see a sunrise . and in this crystally-clear moment of awareness , when the sun begins to shine on the hangs of the astonishing beautiful landscape , all of a sudden , what they &apos;ve learned in the abstract field is astonishing . and the priest comes back and says , &quot; you know , it &apos;s really what i &apos;ve been telling you . &quot;
310	one of them is required by the big selection of different salad rescues , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salad rescue is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that would have been better . and what happened is this shape-shaped alternative that makes you regret the decision , and that regret seems negative on the satisfaction that you made from your decision , even though it was a good choice .
3584	and what i found really extraordinary was he &apos;d collected newspaper snippets of my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won at a letter competition in the second grade , whether i &apos;d gone to halloom &apos;s finders in the parade , whether i had my scholarship or one of my athletic settlements , and he used those snippets to teach his students , medical school students from the medical school and the medical school slaughter medical school , and hey medical school .
1819	and if you have people in front of themselves who are the strong conviction that they have a soul , or you can also say , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been brought from the soul to life , then they imagine that it &apos;s sort of like the soul is such a spiritual framework about them , not out of matter , they &apos;re just out of meat and blood , something rocky , in some sense , to the earth &apos;s inherent , delicate , insignificant , insignificant , insignificant , immortal , insane .
820	as computer scientists -- inspired by the kind of interacting with real objects -- along with my professional , patti and my colleague , jeevan kalanithi , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers that would be instead of a mouse cursor that moves like a digital fingertip on a flat screen of paper -- what if we could intervene with both hands and could intervene physically and hug them the way we want to do it ?
1125	so , i &apos;d like to summarize this to my talk , and that is in the sense that the properties and the skills that we have come from the vot age , and that have gone a little bit like us in the machine age , that the help of the so-called cyber age , we can be activated again , and that we &apos;re , in this way , about complex , technological new products , not actually coming back into the future , but actually , back to our roots .
64	the young acolystas are separated from three and four years of their families , and in a shaky world of finstars , in stone huts at the age of the glacier for 18 years . two niches of every nine years , at the same time , to mimic the nine months of pregnancy that they spent in the lap of their mother , they &apos;re now spending metamorphically in the great mother &apos;s lap .
4985	at this point , jafour said to octavio , &quot; what happens when we take an unparalled area of our country -- what if we just gave them a message -- a part of the american embassy , a part of the canadian bottleneers -- and then when people want to go to work under the canadian rules or the united states , can they work there , and can do anything in the area of these regions that they usually have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
3615	i want to end with a poem written by a persian poet called hafiz in the 14th century , and he told me about my friend jacques bois , and the poem is called &quot; the god who only knows four words . &quot; every child knows god , not the god of the name , not the god of the bow , but the god who only knows four words and repeats them all the time , he always says : come , dance with me . &quot;
205	if someone who &apos;s had the trouble and collected all of these sacred and shared who they &apos;re all , then my photograph will be enriched by the notre dame-cathedral suddenly with all of this data , and i can use it as an initial place to dive in this room , in these metaverse photographs that take photographs of other people , and then make a kind of cross-sharp social experience with other people &apos;s use .
1927	a huge history of success , but we also have , of course , the problem of growing entrepreneurship , and then we have two-thousand-six , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start small and go back and look at the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what i think is going to talk about , again , crazy , that &apos;s going to start again , that people say , &quot; what &apos;s going to happen , this is not all we &apos;re talking about . &quot;
72	there &apos;s not a lot of room for this in the malaria devastating swells of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but they still , through time and ritual , formed a mysterious nimbus of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being consciously close to it , but on a much more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s being inherited into human consciousness .
6523	so that the system develops to create backups that are easier to make errors that make people inevitable and make them incredibly useful , supportive spaces in which anyone who observes the health care can actually address things , which are potentially errors and even rewarded for them , and specifically for people like me who make mistakes and should be rewarded for the gratification of these rewards .
87	i even talked to my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who wrote the psychedelic rea with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 300s , and i claimed about it . i claim you couldn &apos;t order these tryptamins as hallucinogeneous because the moment you feel the impact , you &apos;re not there anymore to experience a hallucination .
2054	many of you will know the story , because from steves , articles later , a book that was filmed again , robert downey junior , when steve lopez and jamie foxx was a nathaniel anthony ayers , the contrabassistant who studied at the juillid conservatory , and whose promising career was tragically held through his aneparoid schizophrenia early on .
6666	now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents are using foreign officers like gmail , because they know that they can trust more than local providers , and that they &apos;re encoded by ssl connections , so that the local government cannot sniff around in their conversations .
3984	for example , women who really diffused the vote , the concept of the founding fathers , which says that anatomic commonality is more important than the anatomic difference , and said , &quot; that we have a uterus and an ovarian than difference , not enough , that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to have in full citizenship , the right to own , etc . &quot;
2444	and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and they &apos;re involved with nasa , and they &apos;re sitting in the nasa precognition council , and they &apos;re doing real space mixes . they &apos;re going to russia , and they &apos;re going through the mission of biomedical protocol all around it , and then they &apos;re going to go to the international space station , and they &apos;re taking our 3d-amerasite team .
6511	in my show , &quot; white coat , black art. &quot; i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from the rescue assistant to the director of the cardiologist , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about your ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show with the microphone .
2463	if you go back to land and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiber glass , the weakness , and all the way around it , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human capacity , if you &apos;re working on the lake , &quot; you can &apos;t explain the other one . it &apos;s like a police officer or a military that did something together , and you know you can never explain it to anyone .
